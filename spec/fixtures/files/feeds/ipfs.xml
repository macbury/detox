</p>

<p>Permanence and immutability are part of the core value proposition of a non-fungible token (NFT). Unfortunately, many NFTs being targeted at consumers today offer neither of these properties due to fundamental design flaws. It is common to hear claims that NFTs ‚Äúlive on a blockchain forever‚Äù, but frequently, due to the cost and space limitations of storing data on a blockchain, only the ownership <em>record</em> is actually stored, with metadata linking to the actual content of the NFT.</p>

<p>All too often, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdj79/peoples-expensive-nfts-keep-vanishing-this-is-why">these links are fragile</a>, and direct the user to a specific <em>location</em> using the HTTP protocol, rather than a specific asset. This means that the content pointed to by the link could change or go offline at any point in the future, leaving the original asset lost forever (and the record of ownership worthless).</p>

<p>The InterPlanetary Filesystem (IPFS) can help address these concerns, and NFTs that leverage IPFS gain several advantages. However, adhering to established conventions is critical to ensure the permanence and accessibility of data stored on the network. With non-fungible tokens (NFTs) surging in popularity, it‚Äôs a good time to revisit best practices for linking and storing NFT data on IPFS. In this post, we‚Äôll address two areas of recent concern in particular: content addressing and content integrity. You can find more details on the IPFS documentation site, in our new article <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/best-practices-for-nft-data/">Best Practices for Storing NFT Data using IPFS</a>.</p>

<h2 id="content-addressing">Content Addressing</h2>

<p>IPFS <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/cid/">content identifiers</a> (CIDs) are an extremely robust and flexible way to uniquely identify any content, no matter where or how it is stored. To take maximum advantage of these strengths, developers should adhere to the following recommendations and conventions for linking to IPFS data.</p>

<h3 id="linking-overview">Linking Overview</h3>

<p>This blog post is not intended to be a comprehensive explanation of CIDs (for that, see other <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#dweb-addressing-in-brief">fantastic resources</a>). However, readers should be aware of the following distinctions:</p>

<h4 id="cid">CID</h4>

<p>A CID is a self-describing, unique identifier for a piece of content.</p>

<p>Example: <code>bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi</code></p>

<p>CIDs should be used inside your application code and in other contexts where it‚Äôs unambiguous whether you‚Äôre using IPFS or some other system.</p>

<p>We recommend converting CIDs to IPFS URIs whenever storing them on disk, especially in metadata and blockchain records that can‚Äôt be altered after creation. Including the <code>ipfs://</code> URI scheme adds important context to a CID that clearly shows users and automated tooling how to find the content.</p>

<h4 id="ipfs-uri">IPFS URI</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">Uniform Resource Identifier</a>, or URI, is used to specify a particular piece of content in a given context. The context is determined by the URI scheme (appended to the URI as a prefix, followed by <code>://</code>). The URI scheme for IPFS is simply <code>ipfs</code>. The URI can optionally include a path appended to the end.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ipfs://bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi</code></li>
<li><code>ipfs://bafybeigvafaks2bvivtv46n2z7uxszpvl25jhvzc6dbhnjjgjkbeia5jta/nft.mp4</code></li>
</ul>

<p>IPFS URIs are the canonical representation for an IPFS link pointing at a file or a directory. When linking from a smart contract to IPFS data, use IPFS URIs to clearly indicate that the data should be retrieved using IPFS.</p>

<p>IPFS URIs should also be used inside the structured metadata for NFTs when linking to images and other media assets stored on IPFS.</p>

<h4 id="http-gateway-url">HTTP Gateway URL</h4>

<p><a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#http-gateways">HTTP gateways</a> provide interoperability for legacy browsers that cannot resolve IPFS URIs natively. Such links should only be used in an application‚Äôs presentation layer, and should not be stored on a blockchain or inside NFT metadata.</p>

<p>Example: <code>https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi</code></p>

<p>Note that HTTP gateways <em>recentralize the distribution of content</em>, presenting both a man-in-the-middle vector and single point of failure ‚Äî if the gateway operator goes offline or is unreachable, the link will break. However, browsers with built-in support for IPFS (either via the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/">IPFS Companion</a> browser extension, or via native support, such as <a href="https://brave.com/ipfs-support/">provided by Brave</a>) are immune to these problems, as they can <em>automatically</em> extract the CID from such links, and load the data from IPFS according to user preferences.</p>

<h3 id="addressing-in-various-contexts">Addressing in Various Contexts</h3>

<p>Developers should format links differently, depending on context.</p>

<h4 id="on-chain">On-Chain</h4>

<p>An NFT smart contract should return an IPFS URI to the assets and metadata associated with each token.</p>

<p>For example: <code>ipfs://bafybeibnsoufr2renqzsh347nrx54wcubt5lgkeivez63xvivplfwhtpym/metadata.json</code></p>

<p>We recommend generating the IPFS URI before minting each token and storing the full URI on-chain. This is the simplest way to conform to smart contract interfaces that expect a URI, and the ipfs:// URI scheme makes it easy for any distributed app to see that the data is available using IPFS.</p>

<h4 id="metadata">Metadata</h4>

<p>In token metadata, IPFS URIs should be used as the most unambiguous and future-proof method of linking to IPFS resources in plain text.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example of an IPFS URI that references an NFT media asset: <code>ipfs://bafybeigvafaks2bvivtv46n2z7uxszpvl25jhvzc6dbhnjjgjkbeia5jta/nft.mp4</code></p>

<p>Developers may optionally wish to include links to public <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#http-gateways">HTTP gateways</a> for legacy interoperability.</p>

<p>Other alternatives for linking to the content (e.g., non-gateway HTTP URLs) should ideally be avoided. As the content served over HTTP from a particular location is subject to change, such a link cannot be relied upon as anything other than a temporary content mirror. On a blockchain, where data is permanently and immutably stored, referencing content via HTTP is thus fragile and risky.</p>

<p>In contrast, IPFS URIs are valid forever, and as such, may safely be considered the canonical link for their data. By using an IPFS URI as the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for links, an application can easily support multiple storage solutions or switch to different gateways over time, simply by generating new gateway links. This is more flexible than ‚Äúhard-coding‚Äù a specific gateway into a permanent blockchain record.</p>

<h4 id="application">Application</h4>

<p>In user-facing applications, developers should link to IPFS content via both:</p>

<ol>
<li>An IPFS URI</li>
<li>An HTTP gateway URL</li>
</ol>

<p>until such a time as more browsers support native resolution of the IPFS URI scheme. Note that both kinds of link can easily be generated from a raw CID or IPFS URI as needed.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an HTTP gateway URL targeting the public gateway at dweb.link:</p>

<p><a href="https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafybeigvafaks2bvivtv46n2z7uxszpvl25jhvzc6dbhnjjgjkbeia5jta/nft.mp4">https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafybeigvafaks2bvivtv46n2z7uxszpvl25jhvzc6dbhnjjgjkbeia5jta/nft.mp4</a></p>

<p>The same link can be written with the CID as a subdomain, instead of in the URL path:</p>

<p><a href="https://bafybeigvafaks2bvivtv46n2z7uxszpvl25jhvzc6dbhnjjgjkbeia5jta.ipfs.dweb.link/nft.mp4">https://bafybeigvafaks2bvivtv46n2z7uxszpvl25jhvzc6dbhnjjgjkbeia5jta.ipfs.dweb.link/nft.mp4</a></p>

<p>Both examples correspond to this canonical IPFS URI: <code>ipfs://bafybeigvafaks2bvivtv46n2z7uxszpvl25jhvzc6dbhnjjgjkbeia5jta/nft.mp4</code></p>

<h2 id="integrity">Integrity</h2>

<p>A major concern for NFTs is the integrity of the asset - this includes both the asset itself and any data associated with it. IPFS protects the integrity of NFT data by using CIDs to validate that nothing has changed since the link was created.</p>

<p>Developers should adhere to the following recommendations to gain the most benefit from IPFS&rsquo;s built-in data validation.</p>

<h3 id="linking-metadata-to-its-asset">Linking Metadata to its Asset</h3>

<p>A token‚Äôs metadata should be considered integral to the value of an NFT. Thus, to preserve the asset‚Äôs value, metadata should be stored on IPFS with the asset, to ensure that both remain accessible.</p>

<p>The preferred method for achieving this is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create two new directories (one for the asset, and one for the metadata)</li>
<li>Add the asset to its directory</li>
<li>Add the asset‚Äôs directory to IPFS, noting its CID</li>
<li>Create the metadata in its own directory, referencing the asset using the CID from (3) to create an IPFS URI. The URI should include the CID of the directory and the filename of the asset.</li>
<li>Add the metadata‚Äôs directory to IPFS, noting its CID</li>
<li>Use the CID from (5) to create an IPFS URI for the metadata and store the URI on-chain to form the record of ownership</li>
</ol>

<p>This process both preserves the ability of developers to include filenames in their links (valuable for user interaction), while ensuring that the metadata and asset can be referenced independent of each other.</p>

<ul>
<li>The metadata will be accessible at: <code>ipfs://{metadata-directory-CID}/metadata-filename</code></li>
<li>The asset will be accessible at: <code>ipfs://{asset-directory-CID}/asset-filename</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example of some JSON metadata that contains an IPFS URI linking to an image file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;No time to explain!&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;I said there was no time to explain, and I stand by that.&quot;,
  &quot;image&quot;: &quot;ipfs://bafybeidfjqmasnpu6z7gvn7l6wthdcyzxh5uystkky3xvutddbapchbopi/no-time-to-explain.jpeg&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The image can be fetched using the IPFS URI <code>ipfs://bafybeidfjqmasnpu6z7gvn7l6wthdcyzxh5uystkky3xvutddbapchbopi/no-time-to-explain.jpeg</code>. For presentation, your application can create a gateway URL to allow users to fetch the image using HTTP, for example, <a href="https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafybeidfjqmasnpu6z7gvn7l6wthdcyzxh5uystkky3xvutddbapchbopi/no-time-to-explain.jpeg">https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafybeidfjqmasnpu6z7gvn7l6wthdcyzxh5uystkky3xvutddbapchbopi/no-time-to-explain.jpeg</a></p>

<p>Once the metadata has been created, it is stored as a JSON file on IPFS, and the resulting CID is used to create a URI like <code>ipfs://bafybeibnsoufr2renqzsh347nrx54wcubt5lgkeivez63xvivplfwhtpym/metadata.json</code>, which can be stored in a smart contract.</p>

<p>To see a working example of this process in action, check out <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/mint-nfts-with-ipfs/#a-short-introduction-to-nfts">How to Mint NFTs with IPFS</a> on the IPFS documentation site, which shows the whole process in detail using javascript.</p>

<h3 id="high-availability">High Availability</h3>

<p>One of the primary reasons for using a decentralized network like IPFS to serve content is to forestall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>. This is achieved by allowing other nodes in the network to mirror data via cohosting. However, developers wishing to ensure the availability of content should not rely on the altruism of other nodes. To ensure that linked content remains available, developers should host it themselves by <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/">pinning</a> the CIDs of the content on IPFS nodes they manage, preserving and distributing the content alongside any others who wish to help. Should they prefer, developers can also delegate this responsibility via <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/work-with-pinning-services/">pinning services</a>.</p>

      <description>We are many people! Whether on Twitter, Zoom or paying the electricity bill, we assume identities to interact with others online.</description>

</p>

<p><strong>We are many people!</strong> Whether on Twitter, Zoom or paying the electricity bill, we assume identities to interact with others online. How much of that identity is you? How much of ‚Äúyou‚Äù is decided by those services? Why can‚Äôt the bag of bits that is ‚Äúyou‚Äù stick around while hopping from online service to online service?</p>

<p>Well now it can! Decentralized identity services have matured to a point where usage is simple, they‚Äôre backed by public networks firmly rooted into the global business firmament, and now we‚Äôre seeing those businesses deploy them in earnest.</p>

<p>Today, we‚Äôre excited to see a new decentralized identity service launch which stores its data on IPFS: Congratulations ION for launching v1.0!</p>

<h2 id="ion-and-ipfs">ION and IPFS</h2>

<p>ION is a public identity network providing distributed public key infrastructure through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree">Sidetree protocol</a> on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. ION is developed by Microsoft and a group of collaborators at the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve been working with them to support their use of IPFS since 2019. IPFS comes into the picture at the storage layer, where ION aggregates transactions into batches, adds those batches to IPFS, and then writes the IPFS content identifier (CID) of the batch to the blockchain. The ION pairs with a local go-ipfs node for publishing data for availability to the broader IPFS network.</p>

<p>Additionally, ION has a network explorer at <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">identity.foundation/ion/explorer/</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/img/ion-explorer.png" alt="ION network explorer">
</p>

<h2 id="using-and-contributing-to-ion">Using and Contributing to ION</h2>

<p>Today Microsoft launched v1.0 of ION, and in <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/ion-we-have-liftoff/ba-p/1441555">the launch post</a> they&rsquo;ve shared examples of using the JavaScript client for application integration and steps for running a node. The team has created a high-level SDK for easy app integrations, with key and DID generation utilities and basic login APIs. Additionally they‚Äôve published a low-level SDK for building customized identity solutions beyond what comes out of the box.</p>

<p>As ION is a public network, running a node of your own will contribute to the overall health, resilience and performance of the system. Instructions for building and installing a node are detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>Try ION today for an identity solution which gives your users more control and let us know how it goes! Share your feedback in the ION repo or let <a href="https://twitter.com/ipfs">@IPFS</a> know on Twitter.</p>

<p>The annual premier hackathon event for the North American Ethereum community, ETHDenver and ColoradoJam, has come to a close. The 2021 event was 100% virtual, utilizing the gaming platform Gamerjibe as a virtual event venue, creating a unique and refreshing way for the dweb community to gather together.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

<h2 id="event-highlights">Event highlights</h2>

<p>When it came to building with IPFS, we saw NFT marketplaces, decentralized and off-chain gaming, platforms solving real world issues involving life insurance and genetic testing, and consistently created ways to lower barriers for wallet creation, token creation, and more.</p>

<ul>
<li>31 out 86 total projects submitted to ETHDenver applied for IPFS bounties</li>
<li>64 out of 86 projects submitted applied for IPFS-ecosystem tooling bounties (the most popular being Ceramic, Textile and Metamask)</li>
<li>The IPFS project awarded bounties to 11 submissions for their creative use of IPFS</li>
<li>32 of the 51 winning projects were award bounties for using IPFS-ecosystem tooling</li>
</ul>

<p>See all of the <a href="https://ethdenver2021.devfolio.co/submissions">ETHDenver submissions here</a> and read <a href="https://medium.com/ethdenver/ethdenver-coloradojam-2021-bounty-track-quadratic-funding-winners-805cf5f2de76">about the winners</a>, too!</p>

</p>

<h2 id="the-virtual-castle">The Virtual Castle</h2>

<p>Alongside the event Discord, the livestream, and the hacks, ETHDenver also created a virtual venue for attendees to wander around, try on swag, gather collectibles, check out sponsor booths, and hang out as a community.</p>

<p>In lieu of a sponsor booth, the IPFS Help Desk returned! Folks from IPFS, Slate, Fleek, Pinata, Opera, and Foundation all took turns hosting as their digital avatars, even occasionally running into a rainbow Pegabufficorn.</p>
