        <p>Isaiah Elliott, a 12-year-old boy who lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is fond of his neon green Nerf gun—which has the words "ZOMBIE HUNTER" written on it.</p>
<p>Last week, during a virtual classroom session, Elliott briefly picked up his toy gun, causing it to appear on screen for just a few seconds. This was noticed by his teacher, who promptly alerted the authorities. As a result, the police paid a visit to Elliott's home and the school suspended him for five days.</p>
<p>The teacher was fairly certain the gun was a toy, according to <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/problem-solvers/12-year-old-suspended-over-toy-gun-seen-in-virtual-class/">local news station KDVR</a>. But instead of checking with the parents to assuage any doubts, the school went straight to the cops.</p>
<p>In a statement, the district explained that all school board policies would be enforced regardless of whether "we are in-person learning or distance learning."</p>
<p>"We take the safety of all our students and staff very seriously," said the district. "Safety is always our number one priority."</p>
<p>This explanation—<em>we are just enforcing the policy equally</em>—might make make more sense if the policy itself was logical, but deploying the police to deal with a nerf gun would have been ridiculous even if the incident took place in a physical classroom. The fact that the other students were, in this case, even further removed from the nonexistent danger just makes the situation even more ridiculous.</p>
<p>"For them to go as extreme as suspending him for five days, sending the police out, having the police threaten to press charges against him because they want to compare the virtual environment to the actual in-school environment is insane," said Dani Elliott, the boy's mother.</p>
<p>Another kid, an 11-year-old whose airsoft gun briefly appeared on screen during a Zoom class, <a href="https://kdvr.com/video/12-year-old-speaks-about-suspension-for-toy-gun-during-zoom-class/5825076/">was similarly suspended.</a> There are many reasons to oppose virtual learning as the new default for American public K-12 education: Perhaps most importantly, it neglects school's vital role as a form of daycare. But the opportunity for the state to invite itself into the home and make trouble for hard-working parents and innocent children is also a serious concern.</p>
<p>There's one more wrinkle here: Unbeknownst to parents, Elliott's school had been recording the Zoom session. The school did say it would abandon this practice, though it makes little difference to Elliott's parents: They wisely decided to transfer him to a private or charter school.</p>

                />            </div>
        <p>The Republican National Convention last month <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/02/trumps-vague-commitment-to-criminal-justice-reform/">highlighted</a> Donald Trump's support for the FIRST STEP Act, a 2018 law that Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript">called</a> "the most significant criminal justice reform of our generation." A <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/first-step-act-2018-one-year-implementation">new report</a> from the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) describes what that reform has accomplished so far: During the first full calendar year in which the law applied, it resulted in shorter sentences for more than 4,000 drug offenders. While that is nothing to sneeze at, it is a modest accomplishment in the context of a federal prison system that keeps <a href="https://www.bop.gov/mobile/about/population_statistics.jsp#pop_totals">more than 150,000</a> Americans, including <a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp">more than 68,000</a> drug offenders, behind bars.</p>
<p>The FIRST STEP Act sentencing reform with the biggest impact in 2019, measured by the number of people affected, was retroactive application of the lighter crack cocaine penalties that Congress <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/1789">approved</a> in 2010. Congress raised the mandatory-minimum weight thresholds, moving them closer to the thresholds for cocaine powder while maintaining a still <a href="https://reason.com/2007/05/23/crackbrained-crack-crackdown/">irrational and unjust</a> 18-to-1 ratio (down from 100 to 1). In 2019, the USSC report says, 2,387 already imprisoned crack offenders qualified for shorter sentences under the FIRST STEP Act's retroactivity provision. The average reduction was 71 months, making the average sentence for this group 187 months (more than 15 years), down from 258 months (more than 21 years).</p>
<p>The second most significant FIRST STEP Act sentencing reform in 2019 (again, measured by the number of people affected), was its widening of the "safety valve" that allows low-level, nonviolent drug offenders to avoid mandatory minimums they otherwise would receive. The USSC reports that 1,369 defendants benefited from that expansion in 2019. The average sentence for that group was 53 months (more than four years), compared to 36 months (three years) for defendants who already were eligible for the safety valve. The average sentence for federal defendants who receive mandatory minimums, based on data for fiscal year 2016, is <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/2017-overview-mandatory-minimum-penalties-federal-criminal-justice-system">138 months</a>, or more than 11 years.</p>
<p>Two other FIRST STEP Act sentencing provisions had a much smaller impact. The law narrowed the criteria for the enhanced penalties that apply to repeat drug offenders, which reduced the number of defendants eligible for those sentences. The enhanced penalties applied to 849 drug offenders in 2019, 152 fewer than in fiscal year 2018. The FIRST STEP Act also reduced the enhanced penalties, from 20 to 15 years for defendants with one prior conviction and from life to 25 years for defendants with two prior convictions. In 2019, the USSC says, 219 drug offenders benefited from the first reduction, while 21 benefited from the second reduction.</p>
<p>Even rarer were situations where defendants received shorter sentences because of the FIRST STEP Act's changes to a law that imposes escalating mandatory minimums on drug offenders who have firearms. The USSC says 205 defendants benefited from that provision in 2019, receiving sentences of five, seven, or 10 years rather than the 25-year sentence that previously would have applied.</p>
<p>The FIRST STEP Act was supposed to facilitate <a href="https://reason.com/2020/05/12/federal-judge-calls-plea-bargain-deals-that-limit-compassionate-release-appallingly-cruel/">compassionate release</a> of elderly or ailing prisoners. In 2019, 145 prisoners were granted compassionate release, five times the number in fiscal year 2018.</p>
<p>The law also expanded the "good time" credits that allow prisoners to be released early. Although the USSC report does not analyze the impact of that provision, the Justice Department <a href="https://reason.com/2019/07/19/thousands-freed-from-federal-prison-by-first-step-act-reforms/">reported</a> last year that more than 3,100 prisoners had benefited from it.</p>
<p>By the end of last year, then, more than 7,000 people either had been released from prison earlier than they otherwise would have been or were serving sentences that will end sooner than would have been the case before the FIRST STEP Act took effect. That is a meaningful accomplishment. Thousands of people will spend less time behind bars, and more time with their families, friends, and neighbors, thanks to this law, and that number will rise each year.</p>
<p>At the same time, the law's beneficiaries at this point represent less than 5 percent of the <a href="https://www.bop.gov/mobile/about/population_statistics.jsp#pop_totals">federal prison population</a>, less than 11 percent of <a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp">drug offenders</a> in federal prison, and less than 10 percent of <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/research/data-reports/overview-federal-criminal-cases-fiscal-year-2019">federal criminal cases</a> each year. And while a crack offender who serves 15 years rather than 21 years in prison surely is better off, the reduced penalty is still draconian, especially if you think peaceful transactions involving arbitrarily proscribed intoxicants should not be treated as crimes to begin with.</p>
<p>Even leaving aside the moral bankruptcy of drug prohibition, the FIRST STEP Act fell far short of reforms that have gained bipartisan support in Congress. In addition to making shorter crack sentences retroactive and widening the safety valve, the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1410/summary">Smarter Sentencing Act</a>, which was introduced by Sens. Richard Durbin (D–Ill.) and Mike Lee (R–Utah) in 2014, would have cut mandatory minimums for drug offenses in half. That bill <a href="https://reason.com/2014/02/05/recovering-from-a-punitive-panic/">passed</a> the Senate Judiciary Committee with the support of three Republicans and 10 Democrats. The <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/senate-bill/619">Justice Safety Valve Act</a>, which Sens. Rand Paul (R–Ky.) and Pat Leahy (D–Vt.) introduced around the same time, would have gone further, making mandatory minimums <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2013/09/17/rand-paul-we-went-crazy-on-the-war-on-dr">effectively optional</a> by allowing judges to depart from them in the interest of justice. Joe Biden, Trump's Democratic opponent in this fall's presidential election, likewise <a href="https://joebiden.com/justice/">favors</a> abolishing mandatory minimums, along with the distinction between the smoked and snorted forms of cocaine (both of which he <a href="https://reason.com/video/joe-bidens-bold-thinking-shredded-civil-liberties-and-destroyed-lives/">supported</a> as a senator).</p>
<p>As its name indicates, the FIRST STEP Act, which passed the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2018215">House</a> and the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00271">Senate</a> with overwhelming support, was not meant to be the last word on criminal justice reform. "We're just getting started," Ivanka Trump promised at the Republican convention. Now is the time to <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/02/trumps-vague-commitment-to-criminal-justice-reform/">spell out what that means</a>.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor Day is a celebration of the labor movement and its representation of the interests of workers in American society. Unions have historically been a force for good as workers fought for better conditions. But 2020 has brought us a reality check about just how toxic organized labor—in the form of police and teachers unions—can be. These organizations aren't solely responsible for the ongoing disaster that is this year, but they've done their best to make it worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On September 4, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, which represents sergeants in the New York City Police Department, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200904180154/https:/twitter.com/SBANYPD/status/1301943424447377410"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: "He we go America this is what a first class whore looks like RITCHIE TORRES. Passes laws to defund police, supports criminals,  &amp; now because he's running for office he blames the police to protect what he voted for. Remember Little Ritchie? Meet LYING RITCHIE @RitchieTorres"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later deleted, the semi-coherent and typo-ridden slam targeted New York City councilman and congressional candidate Ritchie Torres for his allegation that city cops were engaged in a "</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ritchietorres/status/1301882076350816258"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slowdown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" to </span><a href="https://abc7ny.com/nypd-work-slowdown-nyc-crime-violence-shootings/6396831/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> police reform efforts like the ones he </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WPDYXZed-k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The tweet's take-no-prisoners tone is an only slightly exaggerated variation on the usual police union responses to proposals for law enforcement limits and accountability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City's Police Benevolent Association, which represents rank-and-file officers, </span><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-nypd-disciplinary-cases-police-union-20200831-5nrongs73jd45fzfsu2q3lqdz4-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposes standardized penalties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for police misconduct. In July, it </span><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-nypd-disciplinary-cases-police-union-20200831-5nrongs73jd45fzfsu2q3lqdz4-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined in a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with unions representing firefighters and corrections officers to block the release to the public of records of police officers who have been disciplined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union representing New Jersey state troopers </span><a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2020/06/cops-sue-to-stop-release-of-disciplined-officers-names-it-could-hurt-their-families-they-say.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similarly sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep disciplinary records secret. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco's police union </span><a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/union-threatens-legal-action-after-police-commission-expands-use-of-force-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging the city's right to revise its use-of-force policy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">California police unions </span><a href="https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/09/01/police-unions-help-defeat-bill-removing-problem-cops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined together</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to defeat a bill that would have barred officers guilty of serious misconduct from further police work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of this is unusual. "Over the past five years, as demands for reform have mounted in the aftermath of police violence in cities like Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore and now Minneapolis, police unions have emerged as one of the most significant roadblocks to change," </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/us/police-unions-minneapolis-kroll.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in June. "The greater the political pressure for reform, the more defiant the unions often are in resisting it."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is remarkable is that the examples above all came </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd and sparked protests calling for changes in the way police go about their business, especially in minority communities. In context, the unions' response looks like even more of a raised middle finger to an angry public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following months, many of those protests have turned violent. Maybe the riots would have happened anyway; you can't cripple an economy and sideline much of the population with lockdown orders </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/27/pandemic-related-unemployment-and-shutdowns-are-a-recipe-for-social-unrest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">without provoking consequences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But police unions played a big role in bringing us to this point by resisting every effort to make law enforcement less confrontational and intrusive. And their continuing resistance to reform pours fuel on the fires burning in many American cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers unions, too, </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/04/teachers-unions-are-pushing-families-out-of-public-schools/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bear responsibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for worsening the catastrophe known as 2020. It's a union's job to protect the health and safety of its members. But teachers unions consistently went far beyond that mandate, choosing to play politics and push an unrelated anti–school choice agenda rather than focusing on reasonable accommodations in the middle of a national crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As New York City officials struggled at the end of August to get schools reopened with precautions in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the United Federation of Teachers </span><a href="https://www.uft.org/news/press-releases/uft-executive-board-authorizes-further-negotiation-strike-authorization-vote-possible-tomorrow-over"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaged in brinksmanship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leaving parents uncertain as to when, or whether, their kids would be able to resume educations cut short in the spring. The next day, city officials caved and school reopening was </span><a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/09/01/nyc-delays-reopening-of-public-schools"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushed back 11 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, subject to union conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers at Arizona's J.O. Combs Unified Community District </span><a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/arizona/arizona-teacher-s-union-guiding-sick-out-in-district-per-leaked-video/article_6d39f936-e0de-11ea-a220-d3b8c1a9c6d8.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conducted an organized sick-out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leaving families scrambling at the last minute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) </span><a href="https://wearepublicschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SameStormDIffBoats_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wealth taxes, police reform, and a moratorium on charter schools as necessary preconditions for reopening public schools. The union settled for </span><a href="https://www.utla.net/news/utla-members-ratify-ta-95-yes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concessions that were more job-related</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Teachers won newfound respect at the start of the pandemic as parents learned just how difficult it was to teach their kids at home," </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politico</span></i> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/18/teachers-unions-school-reopening-coronavirus-397997"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the flurry of union arm-twisting across the country. "But teachers unions now risk squandering the outpouring of goodwill by threatening strikes, suing state officials and playing hardball during negotiations with districts."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as they hold children's education hostage, teachers unions want to keep the kids themselves as prisoners, unable to choose other forms of learning beyond the walls of hobbled government schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UTLA, along with other unions and Democratic Socialists of America, calls not just for a moratorium on charters, but also on </span><a href="https://www.demandsafeschools.org/demands/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voucher programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that help families pay for private school. They're not alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Association opposes voucher plans, tuition tax credits, or other such funding arrangements that pay for students to attend sectarian schools," the National Education Association (NEA), the country's largest teachers union, says in its </span><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:k2pnWbLeHbQJ:www.nea.org/assets/docs/POLICY_RESOLUTIONS%2520DOCUMENT_2019-2020.pdf+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019–2020 resolutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "The Association also opposes any such arrangements that pay for students to attend nonsectarian preK through 12 private schools in order to obtain educational services that are available to them in public schools to which they have reasonable access."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the NEA insists that homeschooling "instruction should be by persons who are licensed by the appropriate state education licensure agency, and a curriculum approved by the state department of education should be used." That would severely restrict the availability of DIY learning and eliminate its attractiveness for many families seeking something different from government schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kind of power wielded by organized police and teachers, particularly their ability to defy calls for change, comes courtesy not only of these unions' lock on large and powerful tax-funded services, but also their grip on the major political parties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police unions are </span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-gop-and-police-unions-a-love-story"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key players</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Republican Party. This year, to nobody's surprise, they are </span><a href="https://abc7ny.com/pat-lynch-donald-trump-rnc-gop-convention/6392751/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span></a> <a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/19/nj-pba-endorse-trump-van-drew/5607341002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Donald J. Trump for </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-26/republican-convention-california-trump-police-leader-endorsement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reelection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers unions, for their part, are </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2019/06/05/teacher-unions-may-be-more-important-than-ever-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliable and even dominant components</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Democratic coalition. The NEA predictably </span><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2020/03/nea-endorses-joe-biden-for-president.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsed Joe Biden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president, as did the </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/american-federation-teachers-endorses-biden-142651"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Federation of Teachers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political candidates who hope for endorsements, funding, and volunteers from these labor unions tend to do their bidding. That means that police reform is off the table for most Republican officeholders, while educational choice is anathema to many Democrats. Such union-fueled obstructionism is awful at the best of times. But in 2020, as law enforcement and government schools alike are consumed by their own flaws, the unions and their cronies make a difficult time worse by hampering efforts to fix serious problems and by standing in the way of people's efforts to experiment with alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor Day may be an opportunity to celebrate the labor movement. But there's nothing to cheer in the conduct of </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/06/bust-the-police-unions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/04/teachers-unions-are-pushing-families-out-of-public-schools/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teachers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unions.</span></p>

<p>On May 25, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died at the hands of Minneapolis police. Six years ago, after cops killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, just 43 percent of Americans believed that such incidents indicate a systemic problem. Though police killings have remained level since 2014, 69 percent of Americans now agree that "the killing of Floyd represents a broader problem within law enforcement."</p>
<p>Radley Balko is a <em>Washington Post</em> opinion columnist and former <em>Reason</em> reporter who covers police abuse, the drug war, and criminal justice reform. His <em>Reason</em> coverage of Cory Maye—a black man who was put on Mississippi's death row for supposedly killing a police officer during a no-knock raid in 2001—helped bring about Maye's acquittal. His 2013 book <em>Rise of the Warrior Cop</em> (PublicAffairs) was ahead of its time in documenting the dramatic increase in the militarization of local law enforcement and the dangerous incentives and confrontations that creates between police and citizens.</p>
<p>His latest book—<em>The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist</em> (PublicAffairs), co-authored with Tucker Carrington—documents widespread problems with law enforcement, forensic evidence, expert testimony, and media coverage of crime. In June, Nick Gillespie spoke with Balko about how to dial back the militarized police tactics that have become commonplace and whether lasting reform might be possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reason</em>: You've been covering the intersecting topics of the war on drugs, police abuse, and race issues in America for going on 20 years now. Why did the George Floyd killing explode into public consciousness the way it did?</strong></p>
<p>I think [it's] the power of video. If you go back to the civil rights movement, obviously there were abuses going on for a long time in our country's history. The organizers of the civil rights movement in the 1960s really recognized the power of images. They knew there was going to be violence; they knew that the other side was going to be provoked and that was a strategy to win over the middle and white America.</p>
<p>The George Floyd video is indisputable. There have been attacks on Floyd's character, his decisions in life. But there is no excuse for having your knee on a guy's neck for nine minutes.</p>
<p><strong>In the trials of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) cops accused of beating Rodney King, the defense broke the video down, claiming it showed that actually they weren't beating him, and some people thought "Oh, maybe what LAPD was doing was OK." With Floyd, nobody is defending the police action. Is that a sign of progress?</strong></p>
<p>I think it is. There's been a widespread embrace of the idea that police are systematically abusive. The idea of racism in policing in America has crept into white America, into the suburbs. Four years ago, the Democratic nominee for president couldn't say the phrase<em> black lives matter </em>without qualifying it. A lot of people were like that. Now you have [GOP Sen.] Mitt Romney saying it unsolicited. You have people [who] probably haven't protested ever in their lives joining this protest.</p>
<p>Like Michael Brown in Ferguson, like Tamir Rice, a lot of these incidents that have sparked uprisings, none of them are really about those cases in isolation. There have been unjustified police killings of white and black people in cities all over the country over the last 20 years; where we see the uprisings tend to be in places that those stories speak to people on a very personal level. They tap into some long-simmering tension, resentment, pain, fear, despair.</p>
<p>I think with Michael Brown—and, as you say, Rodney King—the fact that the initial narrative had some qualifications or context that made it less compelling gave white people an excuse to dismiss it all as based on a false narrative, and actually ignore the broader long-simmering anger and despair that led to protests in the first place. In this case, there's no contextualizing that video. So it's easier to say, "All right, I'm fully on board with this."</p>
<p><strong>Critics of Black Lives Matter say police abuse is an issue with individual cops, not systemic racism. They'll note in 1971, officers with the New York Police Department killed 93 people. In 2016, they killed nine. They'll say that this is bad, but it is not a big-scale problem.</strong></p>
<p>I think there are two different questions: How systemic is police abuse? And how systemic is racism?</p>
<p>There are lots of things that drive how many times police shoot people over the course of a year, including general crime rates, consensus about how people's lives are, police attitudes, how many police officers are on the force, how well-equipped they are, how well-trained they are. There was a lot more violence, period, in the '70s and '80s, up to the early '90s. My measure of whether a system is corrupt is whether you can point to specific incidents where a bad apple&hellip;has clearly acted corruptly and violated some of these constitutional rights and nothing is done about it.</p>
<p>You can say that bad cops are a tiny percentage of the overall force, but if the system isn't doing anything about those bad cops—or even when it does, they can find a job a county or two over—then it's probably a corrupt system. Yes, it's probably a small percentage of cops who kill people or shoot people or are blatantly racist. But there is an entire culture of covering up, of the idea that cops should always look out for each other—the best interests of cops are prioritized over everything, over justice, over the people they're supposed to be serving.</p>
<p>If you have a system where even the obviously corrupt people are very rarely held accountable, then I think you can say unequivocally that that system itself is corrupt.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about systemic racism? How does it influence policing?</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of misconceptions about what systemic racism is. For a long time I didn't fully understand what it was. Systemic racism is not the idea that everybody is racist on an individual level. It's that the system itself was constructed, built, honed, at a time when racism was written into our laws. It was a day-to-day fact of life. The criminal justice systems that we built during Reconstruction, which hasn't really subsequently changed since the end of Jim Crow&hellip;I don't think it should be particularly controversial to think that those systems that had a purpose at that time probably haven't shed all of the aspects of deliberately wanting racially based outcomes. They're not just going to shed that stuff overnight—it has to be purged from them.</p>
<p>After Ferguson, I went to St. Louis County in Missouri, [which] has over 90 municipalities—an obscene number of cities and towns. During the great white flight to the suburbs from St. Louis, white people would move into a suburb and eventually upper-class/middle-class black people would also move out [to the suburb]. White people didn't like that, so they'd move a mile over and start a new town. This just kept happening all over St. Louis County, and you got postage stamp towns all over the county. Almost all of them have a town council and a police department.</p>
<p>The towns are basically funded [by] a sales tax. If you're a poor town, which tends to be the blacker towns, you're going to get much less revenue from sales taxes, and so they supplement that [with]—or in some cases, their primary sources of revenue are—fines and fees that they extract from their residents. The really pernicious part of this is that the blacker the town, the poorer the town; the blacker the town, the more reliant they are on these fines and fees.</p>
<p>In all these towns, the police don't actually solve crimes. The county police do that. Their sole purpose is to extract revenue from their residents in order to pay their own salaries.</p>
<p>Nobody's going to argue that black cops that are harassing people in [primarily] black towns are racist. You also can't argue that that isn't a racist system built on a racist legacy.</p>
<p>I also think that the whole idea of racism—systemic racism, racial profiling, racism in the criminal justice system—the counter of that is always that you have to look at black crime rates, black-on-black crime.</p>
<p><strong>Over Memorial Day weekend in Chicago, 18 people were killed on May 31—almost all of them victims of black-on-black crime. But we don't hear about that. Some people say that's evidence the conversation is focused in the wrong place.</strong></p>
<p>That's the argument. You look at, for example, stop and frisk in New York City, which is often justified [by saying], "Look at all the black lives stop and frisk saved because it took guns out of the hands of criminals," right? Something like 95 percent of the people who were stopped and frisked, police didn't find anything. If that's the argument, what you're saying is those 95 percent of people who were stopped and frisked who are innocent—that's fine. That's the opposite of individualism, right? We're treating people based on the actions of other people who look like them.</p>
<p>If the argument is that black people commit more crimes, therefore more black people are in prison, that's at least something we can look at the data on. But the idea that racial profiling and stopping and searching innocent people on the side of the road is OK because those people are a member of a group that tends to, I don't know, be more likely to engage in drug trafficking—you're justifying punishing people based on the fact that they're a member of a racial group.</p>
<p><strong>You have written about the Breonna Taylor case, which is a horrifying encapsulation of the way the drug war culminates in terrorizing innocent citizens, through no-knock raids that turn deadly, police militarization, and the like. Do you think that case is driving enough of the conversation for police reform?</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to see it driving more, because I think the use of those tactics is far too common. It used to be that this kind of tactic was only used if you were confronting somebody who was in the process of committing a violent crime, where somebody's life was in immediate risk. What we see in the '80s and '90s is forced-entry raids increasingly—and then dominantly—used to serve drug warrants.</p>
<p>It was a really dramatic shift in the use of that kind of violence, government violence. Before you were using it against somebody who was in the process of committing a violent crime, an active shooter or bank robber or hostage situation. Now, that kind of force is primarily being used against people who are merely suspected of committing nonviolent, consensual crimes.</p>
<p>Most of these raids are not arrest warrants, they're search warrants. They're still in the investigative process. A lot of times it's based on dirty information. The tactics themselves are extremely volatile and violent. They leave very little margin for error. As we see with Taylor, people have died because of it.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, I looked through about 100 no-knock search warrants that were served in Little Rock, Arkansas. About 95 percent of them were illegal, in direct defiance of a Supreme Court ruling, <em>Richards v. Wisconsin</em>. What the court held was that in order to get a no-knock warrant, the police have to show specific information that the person they're going to search is a threat to either attack the police, dispose of evidence, or flee if the cops take the time to knock and announce first.</p>
<p>Every single warrant [I looked at] had this boilerplate language, almost word for word in most of them, that said that all drug dealers are a threat to attack police, dispose of evidence, or flee if the police knock and announce. The Supreme Court has explicitly said that that's illegal. The remarkable thing is the judges [who] were signing off on these warrants were completely oblivious to the fact that they were signing illegal warrants.</p>
<p>In Little Rock, they were using explosives to blow doors off the hinges. If somebody's on the other side of that door, they're lucky to be alive.</p>
<p><strong>Is it that they don't read the warrants, or they do and they just ignore the Supreme Court ruling?</strong></p>
<p>A few years later in <em>Hudson v. Michigan</em>, the Court ruled that yes, the knock-and-announce rule is inherent in the Fourth Amendment—it's part of a "castle doctrine," which is a centuries-old law that goes back into common law—but we're not going to apply the exclusionary rule when the police violate it. Basically, there was no mechanism to actually enforce this requirement. A lot of us predicted this was going to be terrible, because there's nothing stopping police from violating [it]. It's not a rule at all if there's no way to enforce it.</p>
<p>That's what we saw in Little Rock. And in the Taylor case, there were five warrants for that particular drug investigation where the detective requested a no-knock. It was the word-for-word exact same language about drug dealers being violent or a threat to dispose of evidence. In Taylor's case it was particularly pernicious, because her involvement was that she had dated the guy who [had been] under investigation several years earlier—they had broken up years ago—but she had let him use her address to receive some packages in the mail.</p>
<p>Now, if they had actually followed the Supreme Court's guidance, the judge would have required [more investigation] before granting a no-knock [warrant]. They, and the judge, would have learned that her connection to all this was tenuous and that this kind of violence wasn't necessary against her.</p>
<p>The packages that the ex-boyfriend received at her house were clothing and shoes. There weren't even any drugs in the packages. Her only crime was to let a former paramour use her address to receive some clothing in the mail. For that, they kicked down her door in the middle of the night. Her then-boyfriend reached for a gun, which he legally owned. If they'd done some research, they would have known that he stayed there and that he was a licensed gun owner, and they would probably have drawn the conclusion that drug dealers tend not to license their weapons with the government.</p>
<p><strong>Are there theories of policing that are gaining ground that are more consistent with the idea of people being able to pursue life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?</strong></p>
<p>One reform libertarians should be paying a lot of attention to is from a group called Cure Violence that operates in several large cities, but primarily in Chicago. This is an intervention group, so they operate in high-crime areas, and when there's an incident—a homicide or some sort of gang activity, for example—they go in. They have authority, respect, and credibility in the communities where they operate. A lot of times they hire people who used to be in those communities. They'll hire former gang members.</p>
<p>The idea is that they go in and intervene. They try to prevent the violence from spreading, and they try to prevent it before it happens. There's pretty compelling data in Chicago showing that in the neighborhoods where they operated, they had a very substantial effect on reducing the homicide rate. In fact, when the homicide rate spiked in Chicago several years ago, it coincided with the city cutting the funding to Cure Violence. If you look at neighborhood-specific data, it's pretty overwhelming that this group was doing a very good job.</p>
<p>Would that work as a replacement for police? I don't know. Probably not, but the idea that maybe we could redirect a not-insubstantial amount of money that we give to armed officers of the government patrolling these neighborhoods to unarmed people who try to resolve things not with coercion but with negotiation, talking, and mediation is something worth looking at.</p>
<p>Policing has been with us for so long that it's hard to even imagine a country without any sort of armed police at all. But I do think we can think creatively about these things.</p>
<p><strong>Any other reforms that you think are particularly worth focusing on?</strong></p>
<p>One that [the George Mason University economist] Alex Tabarrok wrote about [recently] is that there's no reason why our traffic laws have to be enforced by armed government agents.</p>
<p>A police officer pulls you over and gives you a ticket, which then you take home and decide whether you're going to pay, and you send it in via mail. Why can't you have some sort of civilian traffic corps who, instead of pulling you over, sees you speeding, writes down your license plate, calls it in, and you get a ticket in the mail? The end result is still the same. You get a ticket in the mail that you can pay, or choose not to pay and face the consequences of that. The difference is you're not having this armed interaction [or] confrontation with a police officer, which is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>Our traffic laws need to be about road safety, not generating revenue. There are lots of studies done in Europe about [using] roundabouts instead of stop signs. There have been some really interesting studies about speed limits and how arbitrary they are. Our roads are actually built imagining people driving much faster than speed limits allow, which means cities and towns can place speed limits arbitrarily in a way that maximizes revenue to the city&hellip;.I mean, there are small towns that 40 or 50 percent of their budgets are reliant on traffic revenue.</p>
<p><strong>That idea of driving through small towns and getting a ticket is so deeply embedded in our culture, it's almost impossible to think about a world where you wouldn't be worried about that.</strong></p>
<p>Right. Nobody's saying there should be anarchy on the highways, but we could have speed limits that are more organic, calculated based on how people actually drive. There's a study showing the safest speed limit is the one that's what the 90th percentile of people drive at. Right now [the real speed limits are] far lower than that. That just creates unnecessary interactions.</p>
<p>Think about all the police abuse cases that originated with a traffic stop, and then escalate it from there. Think about all the animus and anger in motorized communities that come from the regular harassment they face from traffic stops. You take those out of the picture and it could go a long way toward rehabilitating the image of the police.</p>
<p><strong>Part of the large issue of reform is really minimizing contacts between the police and citizens.</strong></p>
<p>There's an inherent power imbalance when you're pulled over, and this guy has got six different weapons on his belt, and he's hovering over you while you're sitting in your car looking up at him. If you're part of the community where this happens to you however many times a month—five, six, seven, 10 in some areas—it's easy for somebody who looks like me to say, "You should be respectful to cops and polite to them." If they're harassing you and screwing with you several times a month, eventually you're going to lose your patience. I think we expect people to be perfect in those situations. There are polls showing that black people are more fearful of being a victim of a police beating or shooting than they are of being victimized by a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Are you optimistic about police reform? How will we know when we get there?</strong></p>
<p>I am more optimistic than I've been in a long time. If you look at polling, it's remarkable—support for the protesters jumped 20 points in two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>So much policing is done at the local and state level that there isn't a federal switch we can just flip to say, "OK cops, you can't do this anymore."</strong></p>
<p>The best thing we can do at the federal level is to remove the perverse incentives that are driving bad behavior at the local level. Most of the reform is going to happen at the local level.</p>
<p><strong>In the aftermath of the Floyd killing, the Minneapolis City Council is effectively abolishing the police department as it exists now and replacing it with a different set of operations.</strong></p>
<p>Right, and it's not clear what it's going to look like, but I think it is a good thing. We want to see cities trying different ways of walking that line between public safety and individual rights. The more they try different formulas, the more likely we are to find one that's going to hit on the right equation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[would they be likely to hire blacks for jobs in China, or anywhere where they might have to hear Mandarin?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/03/usc-communications-professor-on-a-short-term-break-for-giving-chinese-word-neige-as-example/">wrote on Thursday</a> about USC Business School professor Greg Patton (who, among other things, is a specialist on business in China) being taken out of his business communication course, and being replaced by a different professor. Prof. Patton's offense: In a discussion of "filler words," such as "um" and "er," he gave the Mandarin "neige" (literally, "that") as a foreign example—and he pronounced the word, as do <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23691">many other Mandarin speakers</a>, similarly to "nigger." The word is apparently indeed used, <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=48302">routinely</a>, as a filler word in Mandarin.</p>
<p><iframe title="DO YOU THINK THIS PROFESSOR SHOULD BE FIRED?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4M0aD78sw8U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The USC business school dean's actions, and his <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/03/usc-communications-professor-on-a-short-term-break-for-giving-chinese-word-neige-as-example/">abject apology for Prof. Patton's actions</a>, has been met (rightly, I think) with a good deal of criticism. I blogged about one example, a letter from nearly 100 USC graduates who say the school's actions "<a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/05/usc-casting-insult-toward-the-chinese-language/">cast[] insult toward the Chinese language</a>." But here I want to suggest that the <a href="https://poetsandquants.com/2020/09/04/usc-marshall-prof-suspended-after-using-a-chinese-term-that-is-similar-to-the-n-word/2/">"Black MBA Candidates c/o 2022" letter</a> demanding the action, and in particular this passage, actually risks harming the employment prospects of black students:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our mental health has been affected. It is an uneasy feeling allowing him to have the power over our grades. We would rather not take his course than to endure the emotional exhaustion of carrying on with an instructor that disregards cultural diversity and sensitivities and by extension creates an unwelcome environment for us Black students. His careless comment has impacted our ability to focus adequately on our studies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let's consider a rational employer who is wondering whether to hire a black applicant to work in China, or anywhere else where the applicant would have to work around Mandarin speakers (whether those speakers form most of the environment or only a modest portion). And let's assume the employer actually believes the factual claims in the letter.</p>
<p>The employer, I take it, will wonder: How will the applicant be able to effectively function around Mandarin speakers, who say the same thing the professor said, except much more often? (To be sure, the word is apparently pronounced differently depending on the speaker's regional accent, but it <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23691">often will be pronounced</a> this way.)</p>
<p>The applicant's mental health, the employer has heard, will be affected. The applicant will be emotionally exhausted. The applicant will be unable to focus adequately on his job. The applicant will feel that the Mandarin speakers are disregarding cultural diversity and his sensitivities (presumably in the process having little interest in <em>their </em>cultural diversity).</p>
<p>Will the applicant be able to work effectively with the Mandarin speakers? Smile and sell products or negotiate deals with them? Be enthusiastic about a job that, by hypothesis, is affecting his mental health, that is emotionally exhausting him, and on which he is unable to focus?</p>
<p>Now say even that the employer reads the letter as limited to relatively high-status, powerful people like a professor saying the word, and thinks that ordinary coworkers or clients' saying it will have zero effect on the applicant's mental health and emotional state. (Not clear why there would be such a sharp difference based on the speaker's power, rather than perhaps a gradient, where ordinary speakers' saying the word would just have a slighter effect on mental health and cause a slighter degree of emotional exhaustion and a lesser loss of focus; but say this is so.) Still, the applicant might have to hear the word when his superiors say it while talking Mandarin; or when a powerful customer of the business says it; or when it's said by teachers speaking Mandarin in a training session within the company.</p>
<p>And the employer may well conclude that it's perilous to try to sort black applicants who have this reaction from those who don't. Imagine the employer decides to try to do such sorting, by asking each interviewee this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many of our employees, business partners, and clients are Mandarin speakers, and we have read that some people find it affects their mental health, emotional composure, and ability to focus when they hear Mandarin speakers say a particular word that sounds somewhat like a racial slur. [In the atmosphere we see at USC, of course the employer will have to speak in this indirect way.] Are you a person who would be affected that way? Or would you be able to ignore such a word, knowing that the similarity is just an accident of the sort that happens with two such wildly unrelated languages?</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you think the employer will feel safe asking this, and confident in the answer? Or will the employer be afraid that even asking such a question would lead to massive public outrage, or perhaps a discrimination claim by someone who says that, yes, his mental health would be affected by hearing the word?</p>
<p>So <em>if </em>the employer believes the USC students' letter, it seems to me the employer has three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Demand that all the Mandarin speakers in the employer's workforce, and among the employer's clients, contractors, and others, change their way of saying utterly commonplace things in their native language. That's <a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/the-10-most-spoken-languages-in-the-world">900 million</a> native speakers—all of them who deal with the employer will have to change the speaking habits of a lifetime, in the name of "cultural diversity and sensitivities."</li>
<li>Not make any such demand, and hire the black applicant, expecting that the applicant will be often suffering damage to his mental health, emotional exhaustion, and loss of focus (and perhaps that the applicant will make similar complaints, to the government, to the public, or to others, when that happens).</li>
<li>Quietly find some way to avoid hiring black applicants, who (he has been assured) suffer from this sort of mental and emotional condition that makes it hard for them to effectively work around the employer's employees and customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 3, it seems to me, is the more likely. That's especially so since it's <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/lawsuits-based-the-hiring-process.html">much harder for plaintiffs to prove discriminatory failure to hire</a> (given that the great bulk of all applicants of all races aren't hired) than to prove discriminatory firing or discriminatory treatment on the job; using this option in the U.S. would be illegal, but we're talking here about is likely to practically happen, not what would happen in a hypothetical world where everyone followed the law. And beyond that, some applicants will be applying for jobs with foreign companies in foreign countries, where U.S. antidiscrimination law doesn't apply.</p>
<p>Now all that is <em>if </em>the employer believes the claims of effect on mental health, of emotional exhaustion, and of loss of ability to focus. I must say that I'm quite skeptical of such claims, which seem to me like political assertions made in a political document ("political" in the sense of politics within the educational institution) and not demonstrable claims about mental health.</p>
<p>If anyone has any real studies that show that hearing a foreign word (whether from a professor or anyone else) that is a homonym for a racial slur actually affects mental health or causes emotional exhaustion, I'd love to see them; but I know of no such studies. My sense is that, just as black criminal lawyers and employment lawyers deal professionally and calmly with having to <a href="http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/epithets.pdf">routinely</a> see and hear (and sometimes write and say) the actual word "nigger" in witness interviews, briefs, oral arguments, and more, so black MBAs who have to routinely hear Mandarin speakers say "neige" aren't really mentally or emotionally damaged by the process.</p>
<p>But presumably the letter was written to be believed. And is it really a good idea for organizations of black students to make assertions that, if believed, will make black graduates less appealing to many rational employers?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Under N.Y. law, "punitive damages shall not be awarded" when the defendant is dead; that's also the general rule throughout the country.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From an opinion by Judge Katherine Polk Failla in <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2019cv08673/523018/81/"><em>Doe v. Indyke </em>(S.D.N.Y.)</a>, decided in late June, but just mentioned in the Westlaw Bulletin:</p>
<blockquote><p>To begin, Defendants seek dismissal of Plaintiff's punitive damages claim on the ground that New York law bars such claims in personal injury suits against representatives of a decedent's estate. The statute in question, § 11-3.2(a)(1) of New York's Estates, Powers and Trusts Law ("EPTL"), provides:</p>
<p>"No cause of action for injury to person or property is lost because of the death of the person liable for the injury. For any injury, an action may be brought or continued against the personal representative of the decedent, <em>but punitive damages shall not be awarded nor penalties adjudged in any such action brought to recover damages for personal injury</em>."</p>
<p>As three recent cases in this District, presenting similar claims against the same Defendants, have recognized, this provision clearly prohibits the award of punitive damages in the situation at hand. <em>See Mary Doe v. Indyke</em>, 2020 WL 2036707 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2020); <em>Lisa Doe v. Indyke</em>, 2020 WL 3073219 (S.D.N.Y. June 9, 2020); <em>Doe 15 v. Indyke</em>, 2020 WL 2086194 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2020) ("New Mexico common law as announced by the state supreme court, like EPTL § 11-3.2(a)(1), bars punitive damages in a personal injury action against a tortfeasor's estate."). Both federal courts addressing constitutional-tort claims under New York law, and state courts in personal injury actions governed by New York law, have concluded similarly. See <em>Mary Doe</em>, 2020 WL 2036707, at *2 (collecting New York federal and state cases).</p>
<p>This position is also reflected in the majority of United States jurisdictions, as the Restatement (Second) of Torts indicates. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmt. a (Am. Law Inst. 1979) ("Punitive damages are not awarded against the representatives of a deceased tortfeasor."). The common justification for the majority rule is that "punishment and deterrence—the recognized bases for imposing punitive damages on a tortfeasor—are not advanced by imposing punitive damages on his or her estate." <em>Mary Doe</em>, 2020 WL 2036707, at *3<em>; see also Blissett v. Eisensmidt</em>, 940 F. Supp. 449, 457 (N.D.N.Y. 1996) (brackets and citation omitted) ("There is a strong policy against the assessment of punitive damages against an estate on account of wrongful conduct of the decedent.").</p></blockquote>
<p>The court also held, consistently with past decisions, that New York law applied, because</p>
<blockquote><p>Plaintiff was domiciled in New York. All of the alleged torts took place in the home Epstein maintained in New York. Further, Plaintiff chose to sue in New York, where her causes of action are timely pursuant to the New York Child Victims Act&hellip;. These facts, taken together, demonstrate that New York's interest in applying its punitive damages rules to this case outweighs the USVI's interest, which exists only because of Epstein's decision to probate his estate there. If anything, it is the USVI, and not New York, that has a "merely fortuitous relationship with the case," minimizing its interest in governing punitive damages.</p></blockquote>
<p>(The court also concluded that Virgin Islands law would likely also preclude punitive damages against dead tortfeasors, but in any event New York law definitely precluded such damages, and it was New York law that applied.)</p>

<p><em>"One of the major obstacles standing in the way of privatizing police operations or even substituting civilians for uniformed employees in nonpatrol positions is opposition from the police unions. Although many police organizations rally behind the cry that only a police officer can do a police officer's job, the fact is that often they are simply trying to protect 'uniformed' slots and create as many openings as possible for fully trained police officers."<br />
</em>Theodore Gage<br />
"Cops, Inc."<br />
November 1982</p>
<p>In 2018, as a gunman murdered 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Sgt. Brian Miller, a deputy with the Broward County Sheriff's Office, hid behind his police cruiser, waiting 10 minutes to radio for help. For his failure to act, Miller was fired. The official cause was "neglect of duty."</p>
<p>In May 2020, however, Miller was reinstated and given full back pay. His 2017 salary was more than $138,000. Miller had challenged his firing, and he had done so with the full backing of his union.</p>
<p>Miller's reinstatement is notable in that it relates to a high-profile case. But the essential story—an officer performs poorly, with fatal results, and the union comes to his defense—is all too common. That is what police unions do: defend the narrow interests of police as employees, often at the expense of public safety. They start from the premise that police are essentially unfireable and that taxpayers should foot the bill for their dangerous, and even deadly, negligence. And although unions are not the only pathology that affects American policing, they are a key internal influence on police culture, a locus of resistance to improvements designed to reduce police violence. To stop police abuse and remove bad cops from duty, police unions as we know them must go.</p>
<p>In case after case, police unions have defended deadly misdeeds committed by law enforcement. In 2014, for example, New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo put Eric Garner in a chokehold for selling loose cigarettes. As a result of Pantaleo's chokehold, Garner died, gasping the words, "I can't breathe."</p>
<p>The incident, caught on video, helped galvanize the Black Lives Matter movement. A grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, but five years after Garner's death, he was fired from the force following a police administrative judge's ruling that the chokehold was, indeed, a violation of department policy.</p>
<p>Pantaleo had violated his police department's policy in a way that resulted in the death of a man who was committing the most minor of offenses. Yet when Pantaleo was finally fired, Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, Pantaleo's union, criticized the city for giving in to "anti-police extremists" and warned that such decisions threatened the ability of city police to carry out their duties. "We are urging all New York City police officers to proceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed 'reckless' just for doing their job," Lynch said.</p>
<p>In essence, the police union's position was: Officers of the law should not be punished for using prohibited techniques in ways that result in the deaths of nonviolent offenders, because to do so would unduly inhibit police work. A deadly violation of department policy is just police "doing their job."</p>
<p>Too often, when police wantonly use deadly force, their unions slow or prevent justice. In March, plainclothes police raided a Louisville, Kentucky, home. They used a battering ram to break down the door in the middle of the night and then fatally shot one of the occupants, an unarmed emergency room tech named Breonna Taylor. Police were investigating two men believed to be selling pot out of another home, but a judge also allowed police to search Taylor's home, because they believed the men were using it for package delivery. The raid was executed under a no-knock warrant that gives police permission to break into a private residence without announcing themselves.</p>
<p>Taylor's death resulted in calls for the officers involved to be fired, but Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer warned that the process would be slow. A significant part of why he expected it to take so long, he said, was the city's collective bargaining agreement with the police union. Fischer lamented the process, saying he recognizes "the system is not a best practice for our community."</p>
<p>The city's police union, meanwhile, has expressed outrage that a city council member described Taylor's boyfriend, who fired on police during the raid, as a hero. This is the union's focus: not demanding justice for a woman killed by police in her home but demanding an apology from a local politician who had the temerity to praise a citizen for defending himself and his girlfriend during a botched police operation. The union's focus has been on protecting the police from public criticism, not on protecting the public from bad policing.</p>
<p>These are anecdotes, but other evidence bears the point out. The Police Union Contract Project, which collects and compares police union contracts across the country, notes that the agreements are generally designed to make it difficult to hold police accountable, in part by giving them privileges that are not afforded to the broader public. For example, the contracts often prevent officers from being questioned quickly after incidents and often give them access to information not available to private citizens. Cities are often required to shoulder the financial burdens of officer misconduct, and disciplinary measures are often restricted. Forthcoming research out of the University of Victoria's economics department finds that the introduction of collective bargaining does not correlate with a reduction in total crime, but it does eventually correlate with higher numbers of killings by police, especially of minorities.</p>
<p>In other words, the research finds roughly what one would expect given a public sector workforce with unions set up to protect police officer compensation while limiting discipline and oversight. Police get paid more, yet the public is no safer—and it's at greater risk of violence by police.</p>
<p>For a study in the ways that police unions can foster cultures of corruption and self-protection at the expense of public safety, consider the case of Camden, New Jersey. For decades, the city was among the most violent in the country, plagued by one of America's highest murder rates and commensurate levels of property crime. In 2012, <em>The New York Times</em> reported, with the murder rate approaching record highs, police acknowledged "that they have all but ceded these streets to crime." City officials said the police union was to blame. Union contracts made hiring officers prohibitively expensive. The cops on the payroll were being paid too much, and they weren't getting the job done.</p>
<p>So the city made a novel decision: Fire the police. All of them. That year, Camden began the process of terminating hundreds of officers and hiring a new force, controlled by the county and initially made up of less expensive, non-union labor.</p>
<p>It was a decision meant to address both budget and crime problems. Naturally, the police union opposed the plan, saying it was "definitely a form of union-busting." City officials, the union said, were relying on a reform that was "unproven and untested," putting faith in an agency that did not yet exist.</p>
<p>By many measures, however, the unproven and untested new police force worked. After Camden disbanded the city police department and reorganized it under the county with lower pay, while adding a focus on rebuilding trust with the community (which is among the nation's poorest), murders declined. The city is still dangerous compared to some others, but there's been clear progress in reducing crime and improving community relations. In May, as residents took to the streets to protest disparate and abusive treatment in black communities, Camden police officers marched with the protesters.</p>
<p>Eight years after the shakeup, Camden police are once again represented by a union. But the new labor representation signed off on a use-of-force policy that is aimed at de-escalation. Police unions have tended to object to such proposals: In 2016, for example, after a think tank put forward a de-escalation policy suggesting that cops think about how the public might react to the use of violence by police, the vice president of the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs called it "a ridiculous piece of claptrap," and the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police collaborated on a joint statement opposing the idea.</p>
<p>Unions aren't the only problem plaguing American police forces; there are plenty of other reforms worth pursuing, from demilitarization to ending qualified immunity. But unions have consistently proven to be a force of organized resistance to calmer, safer, less aggressive policing, in part because of how they perceive the nature of the job.</p>
<p>That has been true in Minneapolis, where the police killing of George Floyd has sparked nationwide protests this year. Bob Kroll, the president of the city's police union, wrote a letter to fellow officers describing Floyd, who was not resisting as an officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes, as a "violent criminal." Kroll has also referred to protesters as part of a "terrorist movement"; argued that officers were wrongly made to hold back on using "gas munitions and less-lethal munitions" to suppress riots; and complained that the officers fired for their involvement in Floyd's death were "terminated without due process."</p>
<p>Like other police union leaders, Kroll has resisted efforts to rein in police aggression. After Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey banned "warrior training" courses that teach violent confrontation, Kroll decried the ban and struck a deal for city cops to take the course anyway. In an interview with STIM radio in April, Kroll lamented the emphasis on training cops to de-escalate tense situations and cast the job as one for people who have a high threshold for violence: "If you're in this job and you've seen too much blood and gore and dead people, then you've signed up for the wrong job." These are the kinds of attitudes that police unions extol and reinforce. They contribute to a workplace culture that views policing as a job for individuals who are unbothered by the results of violence.</p>
<p>Police are public servants granted enormous power over the citizenry. They are tasked with protecting the public and serving their interests. Police unions, in contrast, are tasked with protecting police and serving <em>their </em>interests—even in direct contravention of serving the public. That distinction makes them a barrier to reforms aimed at improving public safety and increasing oversight of law enforcement. If union busting is what it takes to reduce this pernicious influence on policing, then it's time to bust some police unions.</p>

        <p>In early July, a group of linguistics researchers published an open letter calling for the Linguistics Society of America (LSA) to revoke the organization's distinguished fellow status from linguist and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0049B1VOU/reasonmagazinea-20/"><em>The Language Instinct</em></a>,<em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010/ref=sr_1_2?crid=191DYH05JIWKX&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=better+angels+of+our+nature&amp;qid=1597430645&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=better+an%2Caps%2C197&amp;sr=1-2&amp;tag=reasonmagazinea-20">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073TJBYTB/reasonmagazinea-20/">Enlightenment Now</a>.</em></p>
<p>The signatories, many of them graduate and undergraduate students, pointed to years-old tweets of Pinker's that they claimed revealed his racist and sexist biases. Almost immediately, a group of established scholars leapt to his defense. "The letter shows no familiarity with Pinker's work, and takes statements out of context in a way that, with the merest checking, are seen to be represented duplicitously," wrote Jerry Coyne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago. Academics from across the disciplinary and political spectrum joined Coyne in rebutting the letter, including linguist (and <em>Reason</em> contributor) John McWhorter, leftist firebrand Noam Chomsky, and formal semantics pioneer Barbara Partee.</p>
<p>In a conversation with <em>Reason</em> Science Correspondent Ronald Bailey on the day the LSA announced it would not take any action against him, Pinker explained what efforts like the LSA letter tell us about the state of debate in America's elite institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: This LSA letter is an astonishing document. </strong></p>
<p>A: I think it's part of a larger mindset that does not see the world as having complex problems that we fail to understand and ought to try to understand better to diagnose and treat, but rather as a kind of warfare between powerful elites and oppressed masses. In the classic Marxist analysis, these would be economic classes, but they've been transformed to racial and sexual classes.</p>
<p>In this mindset, analysis, debate, evidence are just tools—propaganda exercised by those in power. What has to happen is not a deeper understanding of social problems, but a wresting of power from elites and redistributing it to the disenfranchised.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You've said the letter wasn't specifically about you, but it was quite targeted. </strong></p>
<p>A: It was quite targeted, but it's part of a larger movement seeking monsters to destroy. That is, to look for prominent people and do "offense archeology," which is to troll through tweets and statements seeking to find evidence, however tortured, that there's some kind of prejudice behind them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The writers of the letter said that by challenging the claim that police are more likely to kill black people than to kill white people, you showed a "willingness to dismiss and downplay racist violence regardless of any evidence." </strong></p>
<p>A: That's completely wrong. It's an open question to what extent police are racially biased. As a social scientist, I consider it my responsibility to try to understand that in light of the facts. You're literally committing a logical blunder if you hold a belief that police are more likely to shoot unarmed African Americans and you don't count up all the people police shoot. That is by no means a denial of the existence of racism.</p>
<p>There's a distinct question of whether African Americans are subject to more <em>sublethal</em> harassment, and I think your former colleague Radley Balko wrote a very good summary for <em>The Washington Post </em>that shows there is evidence of racial discrimination in harassment and man-handling and arrests. But when it comes to lethal incidents, the evidence suggests that there isn't.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I'm trying to get a sense, from your point of view, of why your critics would misread what you are doing.</strong></p>
<p>A: [There's a] mindset that we evaluate what people mean based on whether the underlying idea is likely to be true or false; that we should use evidence in doing so; that all of us, in large part, start from a position of ignorance when dealing with social problems; and that the imperative is to understand their causes and therefore arrive at the best possible solutions.</p>
<p>There's an alternative mindset in which the content of someone's statements and attempts to evaluate them with respect to evidence are beside the point. The imperative is not to examine ideas that may be true or false; it is to maximize passion and solidarity. Because the elites are already in a position of power and the downtrodden have only their own solidarity and emotional passion as countermeasures, therefore anything that undermines the passion and solidarity is harmful in the struggle. And it is a struggle! It's a kind of warfare that is zero-sum, and the imperative is to change the power balance.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[More on the Mandarin "neige" controversy.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-05/usc-business-professor-controversy-chinese-word-english-slur">L.A. Times (Nina Agrawal)</a>, also echoed in (un-paywalled) <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/usc-professors-dismissal-over-chinese-word-that-sounds-like-racial-slur-questioned-alum-peers-1529887">Newsweek</a>, based on a (paywalled) L.A. Times article, about the controversy I mentioned <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/03/usc-communications-professor-on-a-short-term-break-for-giving-chinese-word-neige-as-example/">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This week a group of nearly 100 USC alumni, most of whom are Chinese by ethnicity or nationality, wrote to the school's administration in support of their professor, saying his use of the Mandarin word for "that" was accurate and "an entirely appropriate and quite effective illustration of the use of pauses."</p>
<p>The alumni said they were "deeply disappointed that the spurious charge has the additional feature of casting insult toward the Chinese language, the most spoken in the world, and characterized it and its usage as vile."</p>
<p>"We feel Marshall should be open to diversity in all areas," they wrote..</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven't seen the alumni letter; if anyone can point me to it, I'd be much obliged. My personal objection here isn't to the "insult toward the Chinese language" as such; it's to USC's treating some students' objection to hearing the word as a sound criticism and a reason to apologize. Instead, USC should have recognized this as the students' error—an error USC, as an educational institution, <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/03/usc-communications-professor-on-a-short-term-break-for-giving-chinese-word-neige-as-example/">should strive to correct</a>—stemming from lack of understanding about how people should perceive speech in foreign languages.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For decades, the CDC has collaborated with the states to collect data on births in the United States. Among the data collected is "race." </p>
<p>Let's see if you can figure out what the rule was before 1989. If a child had an Asian father and and a black mother, the child was tabulated as being Asian. So let's say a child had a white father and a black mother. Well, the rule must be it goes by the father's race, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>Until 1989, it did go by the father's race, but only if both parents were not white. If one parent was white and the other non-white, the child was tabulated by the race of the non-white parent. I can't think of any good reason for this rule other than the racist assumption that the product of interracial marriage may not be deemed white, but is automatically a member of his non-white parent's group.</p>
<p>Since 1989, the rule has been that a baby's race is tabulated according to the mother's race, regardless of the father's race. This information is retained by the government, but modern birth certificates do not list the child's race. A proposal to do so was shot down a while back, primarily on the theory that the parents may tell authorities that their child is race "X", but as an adult the child might choose to identify otherwise.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Critics are lining up to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/taranurin/2020/08/28/lawmakers-accuse-federal-agencies-of-pursuing-an-anti-alcohol-agenda-in-considering-new-drinking-recommendations/#7e3b89516f46"><span style="font-weight: 400">blast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a report, issued by a federal committee earlier this summer, that urges the government to make steep cuts to the definition of moderate alcohol consumption. These critics are concerned because the group—the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), a rotating crop of experts that meets every five years—is the government's primary vehicle for recommending updates to the nation's dietary policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The DGAC, which was </span><a href="http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015.asp#GO3"><span style="font-weight: 400">established</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 1990, "provide[s] the basis for federal food and nutrition policy and education initiatives.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">" Those policies include everything from recommending how many servings of vegetables people should consume in a day to determining what foods to serve to troops, schoolchildren, and prisoners. Now that the DGAC has issued its </span><a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/ScientificReport_of_the_2020DietaryGuidelinesAdvisoryCommittee_first-print.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">final report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, key </span><span style="font-weight: 400">federal agencies will review and consider its recommendations, along with public comments, before adopting formal guidelines. Alcohol is one area where the DGAC recommendations are stirring the most controversy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The report argues in favor of "reducing consumption among those who drink&hellip; in ways that increase the risk of harms." That sounds eminently reasonable, until you learn the DGAC decided, despite ample </span><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.l6669"><span style="font-weight: 400">evidence to the contrary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, that drinking "in ways that increase the risk of harms" means enjoying a second Bud Light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, the report seeks to halve the DGAC's longstanding definition of moderate drinking for men—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">no more than two drinks per day—to no more than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> drink per day. (The recommendation for women, set for years at no more than one drink per day, remains unchanged.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The proposed change to the alcohol-consumption recommendation is angering everyone from </span><a href="https://www.gobourbon.com/the-federal-government-is-coming-for-your-moderate-bourbon-habit/"><span style="font-weight: 400">bourbon aficionados</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the </span><a href="https://www.beerinstitute.org/press-releases/beer-institute-and-brewers-association-file-comments-highlighting-scientific-and-procedural-inconsistencies-in-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-moderate-alcohol-consumption-guidelines-recommendat/"><span style="font-weight: 400">beer lobbies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://www.winespectator.com/articles/u-s-dietary-guidelines-panel-takes-aim-at-moderate-wine-drinkers"><span style="font-weight: 400">wine connoisseurs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, who—and this is probably an understatement—are "not happy with the report." But top medical doctors and public health experts, along with lawmakers, are also raising objections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last month, five Harvard Medical School faculty doctors—including three who served on one or more prior iterations of the DGAC—submitted </span><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FNS-2020-0015-22152"><span style="font-weight: 400">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that are highly critical of the 2020 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">DGAC report.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> They argue the push to slash the maximum daily alcohol consumption for men is a "limited, arbitrary, and unsystematic treatment of alcohol consumption" that is based on "limited, arbitrary, and unsystematic evidence."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While rightly noting the dangers of binge drinking and consistent heavy alcohol consumption in their comments, the Harvard doctors note the DGAC appears to have "ignored" three decades of research, drinking patterns, and "relevant recent evidence." They also argue the recommendations demonstrate "scientific inconsistency" and an "arbitrary" and biased selection of research. "These arbitrary selections all appear intended to support claims made by members of the DGAC prior to appointment, rather than as systematic and transparent reviews of existing scientific evidence." In other words, the researchers claim anti-alcohol DGAC members focused only on research that supports arguments those members wanted to make all along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wesley Clark, a lawyer, professor, and medical doctor who is also the former director of the U.S. government's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, argued in </span><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FNS-2020-0015-26207"><span style="font-weight: 400">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> he submitted that the DGAC's "over-reaching" changes to the alcohol recommendations appear to result from "biased analysis" and might be "</span><span style="font-weight: 400">a sleight-of-hand vehicle for Prohibition.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other leading experts are also alarmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">"There were very serious violations of scientific protocol regarding this proposal that need careful review," said </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sam Zakhari, Ph.D., chief scientific advisor with the </span><a href="https://www.distilledspirits.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">Distilled Spirits Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and a former senior staffer with the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse &amp; Alcoholism, in a statement emailed to me this week. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">"The committee acknowledged only one study examined differences in risk amongst men consuming two drinks per day as compared to one drink per day, which does not represent the preponderance of the evidence. Further, the committee members cited numerous studies that were outside of the 60 approved studies for review. It doesn't take a scientist to see that the process was seriously flawed and that this proposal appears to be based on preconceived opinions, not science." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many lawmakers in Washington aren't happy with the recommendations, either. A joint, bipartisan group of more than two-dozen members of Congress submitted </span><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FNS-2020-0015-26226"><span style="font-weight: 400">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> opposing the DGAC's dry-ish recommendations. Their comments single out a "lack of scientific evidence to justify any change in current moderate drinking recommendations."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This DGAC controversy does not surprise me. Indeed, it's no stretch at all to argue that the DGAC is best known—in recent years, at least—for its controversial recommendations. In 2015, I </span><a href="https://reason.com/2015/02/28/taxes-and-restrictions-masquerading-as-f/"><span style="font-weight: 400">blasted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the DGAC report for proposing new food taxes, pushing for restrictions on food marketing, and suggesting local food bans. In a separate </span><a href="https://reason.com/2015/06/13/new-article-blasts-feds-pseudoscientific/"><span style="font-weight: 400">column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that same year, I spoke with a university researcher whose analyses, </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0025-6196%2815%2900319-5"><span style="font-weight: 400">published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the esteemed, peer-reviewed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, suggests, as I explained, "</span><span style="font-weight: 400">that the DGAC's work—and the research used to support that work—is so off base as to be scientifically useless.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">" I also detail major shortcomings with the 2015 DGAC's recommendations around sustainability in my book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1610916751/reasonmagazinea-20/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Biting the Hands that Feed Us</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 2020 report isn't all bad. For example, unlike in the 2015 report, I didn't find any mentions of food taxes or bans in the 2020 report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, the DGAC report contains </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">recommendations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, meaning key federal agencies ultimately choose together whether </span><a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/03/11/dietary-guidelines-sustainability-survey/"><span style="font-weight: 400">or not</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to adopt those recommendations. On alcohol at least, the weight of the evidence suggests the federal government should reject the DGAC's deeply flawed recommendations.</span></p>

<p><em>"As it stands in America today, the police aid in the trampling of rights on such a massive scale that there is hardly a word sufficiently descriptive. Limited liability? The price of retribution due to the victims of the crimes committed by police on any single day would be beyond calculation, yet not only do these crimes go undenounced (for the most part), and the perpetrators, police and politicians, unpunished, but, even worse, the victims are forced through taxes to finance the operation and salaries of the criminals."<br />
</em>Lanny Friedlander<br />
"The Cops: Heroes or Villains?"<br />
November 1969</p>
<p>In December 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled that a former Ferndale, Michigan, police officer named Lowell Phillips violated the Constitution when he shot and killed a fleeing suspect. Laszlo Latits "showed a persistent intent to flee but not an intent to injure, and never placed the public or the officers at imminent risk," the court observed of the incident, which began with a traffic stop over a wrong-way turn onto a divided boulevard and ended four minutes later with Latits dead of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen.</p>
<p>Phillips not only "repeatedly violated police procedures in both ramming Latits and running up to his car," the 6th Circuit noted, but Phillips was ultimately fired by the Ferndale police department for that misconduct. "Considering the totality of the circumstances," the appeals court noted, "we conclude that Officer Phillips's use of deadly force was objectively unreasonable and in violation of Latits's constitutional rights."</p>
<p>But then the 6th Circuit switched gears and shielded the disgraced ex-cop from facing a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by the dead man's family. "Caselaw existing at the time of the events," the court said, "did not clearly establish the objective unreasonableness of Phillips's actions in the circumstances of this case."</p>
<p>Welcome to the bizarro world of qualified immunity, a place where the federal courts will acknowledge that a police officer violated the Constitution but then deem the officer not civilly liable for his unconstitutional actions because there was no prior court decision explicitly frowning on the same behavior.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1982 decision in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald</em>, state actors are entitled to immunity from civil suits arising from their official conduct so long as the conduct that they're being sued over "does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights." But as 5th Circuit Judge Don Willett, a leading critic of the Court's qualified immunity doctrine, has complained, what that means in practice is that "public officials [may] duck consequences for bad behavior—no matter how palpably unreasonable—as long as they were the <em>first</em> to behave badly."</p>
<p>Something has gone seriously wrong in our criminal justice system when the federal courts are running this kind of interference on behalf of blatantly unconstitutional police actions. What happened?</p>
<h2>'Shall Be Liable'</h2>
<p>The story begins in 1871. In the aftermath of the Civil War, numerous state and local officials throughout the former Confederacy turned a blind eye (or worse) to the racist domestic terrorism perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan and other groups. Congress responded to this dire state of affairs by enacting a series of so-called enforcement acts, each one rooted in Section 5 of the recently ratified 14th Amendment, which gave federal lawmakers the power "to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." Among the provisions of the 14th Amendment was the requirement that states respect the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most forceful of the enforcement acts was the Civil Rights Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. Among other things, it sought to hold state officials personally liable for the widespread civil rights violations that were occurring on their watch. It did so in part by declaring that "any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage of any State, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any person within the jurisdiction of the United States to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States shall&hellip;be liable to the party injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceedings for redress."</p>
<p>"If the Federal Government cannot pass laws to protect the rights, liberty, and lives of citizens of the United States in the States," declared the bill's principal author, Massachusetts Rep. Benjamin F. Butler, a radical Republican and former Union major general, "why were guarantees of those fundamental rights put in the Constitution at all?"</p>
<p>Butler's handiwork lives on today in modified form in Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code, more commonly known as Section 1983. It features language almost identical to the Ku Klux Klan Act.</p>
<p>Guess what the law does not say? "Neither version of the text, you will notice if you wade through them," University of Chicago law professor William Baude has observed, "makes any reference to immunity." That part came later, when the U.S. Supreme Court invented qualified immunity for cops in the mid-20th century.</p>
<h2>'Clearly Established'</h2>
<p>It's common to think of Chief Justice Earl Warren as one of the towering figures of legal liberalism, a jurist whose record is practically synonymous with what progressives like to call social justice. In the approving words of <em>The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States</em>, "Whether one looks at the Court's record in matters of free speech, separation of church and state, apportionment, racial discrimination, or criminal procedure, Warren and his Court essentially asked the same questions: Is this fair?"</p>
<p>Alas, <em>fair</em> is not exactly the word anyone would choose to describe what happened in <em>Pierson v. Ray</em> (1967), the case in which Chief Justice Warren more or less concocted the idea of qualified immunity for cops. At issue was the 1961 arrest of the Rev. Robert Pierson and several other civil rights activists for entering the "Whites Only" facilities at a segregated bus stop in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1965, in a different case, the Supreme Court ruled against the anti-loitering law those activists were arrested for violating. Two years later, the Court weighed a lawsuit, filed by Pierson and his allies under Section 1983, against the local authorities who wrongfully shackled and jailed them.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, Warren safeguarded the Mississippi cops from the lawsuit. At common law, he argued, "a peace officer who arrests someone with probable cause is not liable for false arrest simply because the innocence of the suspect is later proved." The chief justice then grafted that reasoning onto Section 1983.</p>
<p>"A policeman's lot is not so unhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest when he has probable cause, and being mulcted in damages if he does," Warren declared. "Although the matter is not entirely free from doubt, the same consideration would seem to require excusing him from liability for acting under a statute that he reasonably believed to be valid but that was later held unconstitutional."</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, the Court doubled down in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald</em>. "Government officials are entitled to some form of immunity from suits for damages," the Court said. "Public officers require this protection to shield them from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability." So long as government officials acting under color of law do "not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known," the Court held, those officials "generally are shielded from liability for civil damages."</p>
<h2>'An Absolute Shield for Law Enforcement'</h2>
<p>The problems with qualified immunity are self-evident. Not only does the doctrine shield rights-violating officers from facing federal civil rights lawsuits, but it incentivizes police departments (which are also shielded from liability) to retain bad cops on the payroll. In effect, qualified immunity functions as an anti-accountability measure.</p>
<p>What can be done? There are two possible fixes. The first is for the Supreme Court to reverse or modify its misguided precedents.</p>
<p>At least two justices may be ready to do just that. The Court's "one-sided approach to qualified immunity," objected Justice Sonia Sotomayor in <em>Kisela v. Hughes</em> (2018), "transforms the doctrine into an absolute shield for law enforcement, gutting the deterrent effect of the Fourth Amendment." To make matters worse, "it tells officers that they can shoot first and think later, and it tells the public that palpably unreasonable conduct will go unpunished."</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, meanwhile, has suggested that the doctrine itself might be unlawful. In <em>Ziglar v. Abbasi</em> (2016), Thomas wrote a lone concurrence "to note my growing concern with our qualified immunity jurisprudence" and to urge the Court to "reconsider" that jurisprudence "in an appropriate case."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, when the Court declined to hear <em>Baxter v. Bracey</em>, a case involving the grant of qualified immunity to officers who allegedly unleashed a police dog on a surrendering suspect, Thomas blasted his colleagues for refusing to get involved.</p>
<p>Section 1983 "ma[kes] no mention of defenses or immunities," Thomas pointed out in his dissent. "Instead, it applies categorically to the deprivation of constitutional rights under color of state law." In other words, the judicially invented doctrine does not match the text enacted by Congress. "There is likely no [legal] basis for the objective inquiry into clearly established law that our modern cases prescribe," he wrote. "I continue to have strong doubts about our [Section] 1983 qualified immunity doctrine."</p>
<p>The other fix requires action from Congress and the signature of the president. Because this doctrine arose via the judicial interpretation of a federal law, federal lawmakers need only pass a new statute to expressly repudiate what SCOTUS has done.</p>
<p>That approach is slowly gaining adherents. "Qualified immunity protects police and other officials from consequences even for horrific rights abuses," observed Rep. Justin Amash (L–Mich.) when he introduced the Ending Qualified Immunity Act in the House of Representatives in June. Amash's bill had garnered 65 co-sponsors at the time this article went to press, though a majority of Senate Republicans have declared the idea dead on arrival.</p>
<p>The fight against police misconduct is fast emerging as one of the greatest civil rights issues of our time. Holding abusive officers civilly liable in federal court is a necessary and long-overdue part of that fight. One way or another, qualified immunity for cops deserves to be abolished.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <em><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.363393/gov.uscourts.cand.363393.29.0.pdf">Maffick LLC v. Facebook, Inc.</a></em>, decided yesterday by Judge James Donato (N.D. Cal.):</p>
<blockquote><p>Plaintiff Maffick LLC seeks a temporary restraining order directing defendant Facebook, Inc., to take down a "Russia state-controlled media" label that Facebook posted on Maffick's "In the Now," "Waste-Ed" and "Soapbox" pages&hellip;.</p>
<p>Maffick's TRO application also raises a concern about prior restraint. A court order that forbids speech activities, which is what Maffick seeks, is a "classic prior restraint of speech." "Prior restraints pose the 'most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights,'" and there is a "historical and heavy presumption against such restraints." &hellip;</p>
<p>Although Maffick asserted six causes of action against Facebook in its complaint, Dkt. No. 1, it seeks a TRO on just four of those claims: (1) libel under California Civil Code Section 45; (2) Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A)); (3) the California Unfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 17200); and (4) interference with prospective economic advantage claim under California state law.</p>
<p>The merits inquiry is considerably streamlined by the fact that all four claims hinge on the proposition that the Russian media label is false. Consequently, to win a TRO, Maffick must demonstrate that it is likely to succeed in showing that the "Russia state-controlled media" label is false. It has not crossed that threshold.</p>
<p>Even assuming that the "Russia state-controlled media" label is a statement of fact—and not merely an opinion, as Facebook contends—the record before the Court establishes only that the question of falsity is disputed.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-8083237"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook, on its part, has tendered a substantial amount of evidence in support of its view that Maffick is linked to the Russian government. For example, Facebook has established, without dispute by Maffick, that a prior entity, Maffick Media GmbH ("Maffick Media"), openly acknowledged significant ties to the Russian government. Maffick's Soapbox, Waste-Ed, and In the Now channels on Facebook are virtually identical to the same channels Maffick Media previously sponsored under the same names. Maffick still uses Maffick Media email addresses for these channels—"hello@maffick.media" for In the Now; "waste-ed@maffick.media" for Waste-Ed; and "soapbox@maffick.media" for Soapbox.</p>
<p>Maffick's current CEO, Anissa Naouai, expressly stated in a declaration accompanying the TRO application that she "owned a 49% interest" in Maffick Media, and that another "part-owner" was an entity known as Ruptly GmbH. Facebook submitted evidence that Ruptly is a subsidiary of RT (formerly Russia Today), which is "funded by the Russian government." A "2017 report from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence about Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election" stated that "RT is considered the 'Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet.'"When Facebook temporarily suspended these pages in February 2019, "RT's editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, tweeted&hellip;: 'Facebook has blocked our projects with billions of views!!!' "Naouai's reply declaration also states that while she is a United States citizen, she lived for years in Moscow, was employed by Russia Today, and hosted an opinion show for RT called "In the Now."</p>
<p>This is a considerable amount of evidence in Facebook's favor, and Maffick does not meaningfully contest it. Rather than challenging this evidence directly, Maffick relies almost entirely on declarations by Naouai, its CEO. For the most part, the declarations offer purely conclusory statements to the effect that Maffick is free and clear of Maffick Media and Russia. For example, Naouai avers that she "promptly formed a Delaware limited liability company called Maffick LLC" after moving to Los Angeles in June 2019. She states that while she "chose to continu[e] using the 'Maffick' name for the new LLC, Maffick LLC is not related to or associated with Maffick Media (or Ruptly)." Naouai also declares that "Maffick is not controlled operationally or editorially by the Russian government or by Russian state entities or officials," and further, "RT does not exercise control over me, nor does it exercise control over the content on Maffick's channels."</p>
<p>This evidence is little more than ipse dixit from a party-affiliated declarant. In effect, Maffick contends that it is likely to succeed on the merits because its CEO says so. That is far from enough to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, particularly in light of the largely undisputed counter-evidence Facebook tendered.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Facebook has proven truth as a defense, which it was not required to do in opposition to the TRO, or that Maffick has no hope of prevailing on any of its claims. It means only that Maffick has not carried its burden of demonstrating a probability of success on the merits that might justify the extraordinary relief of an injunction&hellip;.</p>
<p>In light of this determination of the merits issue, the Court need not reach Facebook's argument that the Russian state media label is a non-actionable opinion. The Court also declines to formally rule on Facebook's defensive argument that the proposed injunction would be an unconstitutional prior restraint. The TRO application has been denied for more straightforward reasons, and so definitively deciding the constitutional question Facebook poses at this time is not absolutely necessary&hellip;.</p>
<p>The balance of the equities tips in Facebook's favor, if anything. As the Ninth Circuit concluded in <em>Garcia</em>, the plaintiff's "thin copyright claim" did not outweigh the "historical and heavy presumption against" prior restraints. So too here, where Maffick asks to restrain Facebook's speech on uncompelling evidence of falsity. The Court also notes the public interest served by Facebook's notices to "help its users better understand the sources of news content they see on Facebook" which can help them "make informed decisions about what they are reading." The absence of proof that the balance of hardships tips sharply in Maffick's direction further underscores that an injunction is not warranted, particularly with respect to the "serious question" inquiry&hellip;.</p></blockquote>

        <p>A teen in Oklahoma City <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/national/dangerous-benadryl-challenge-on-tiktok-blamed-for-death-of-oklahoma-teen/">reportedly died</a> in August of an overdose of Benadryl pills, and this tragedy is fueling yet another social media "challenge" panic. Are teens really trying to convince other teens to take tons of allergy pills to get high?</p>
<p>As with all of these social media panics that start bouncing around the web and local news networks, this story has kernels of truth to it while suggesting a trend that is probably exaggerated. Remember the "Tide Pod challenge"? Some teens did genuinely <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tide-pod-challenge/">post videos</a> of themselves eating Tide Pods, and there was a temporary increase in calls to poison control for laundry detergent ingestion. But the kind of national panic that led to involvement by <a href="https://reason.com/2019/12/16/tide-pods-nazis-and-bees-the-top-10-moral-panics-of-the-2010s/">fearmongering lawmakers</a> was just completely over the top relative to the actual risks.</p>
<p>Similarly, the "Benadryl challenge" starts with something real. Three teens in Texas in May sought medical treatment after overdosing on Benadryl. The hospital, Cook Children's Hospital at Fort Worth, <a href="https://www.checkupnewsroom.com/tiktok-videos-encourage-viewers-to-overdose-on-benadryl">posted on its blog</a> that the teens got the idea from a TikTok video that told them they could get high and hallucinate if they took several Benadryl pills. One girl took 14 of them and needed medical treatment.</p>
<p>The Fort Worth <em>Star-Telegram </em>and McClatchy News <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article244266707.html">reached out to TikTok</a> and were told that, yes, the company had removed content from the platform that was violating their community guidelines by encouraging people to take excessive amounts of Benadryl. So TikTok acknowledged the videos existed and has removed them.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the end of August. On August 28, Oklahoma City news outlet KFOR <a href="https://kfor.com/news/local/dangerous-benadryl-challenge-on-tik-tok-blamed-for-the-death-of-oklahoma-teen/">reported</a> that a 15-year-old girl actually died from overdosing on Benadryl, ostensibly because she "fell victim to what's been called the Benadryl Challenge on Tik Tok," according to KFOR's report. The story has bounced around several media sites now, including <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/what-benadryl-challenge-latest-tiktok-trend-alleged-cause-one-teens-death-already-1528712"><em>Newsweek</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8695443/PICTURED-Oklahoma-girl-15-overdosed-doing-viral-Benadryl-challenge-TikTok.html"><em>Daily Mail</em></a>.</p>
<p>The attribution for the cause of death comes from a Facebook post that has been subsequently deleted. <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1404379/tiktok-benadryl-challenge-teen-dead-oklahoma-chloe-phillips/"><em>The</em> <em>U.S. Sun</em></a> and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/03/family-warns-of-tiktok-benadryl-challenge-after-daughter-dies/"><em>New York Post</em></a> identify the girl as Chloe Phillips, a sophomore at Blanchard High School, who died on <a href="https://www.eisenhourfh.com/obituary/chloe-m-phillips">August 21</a>. The Facebook post apparently comes from her Great-Aunt Janette Sissy Leasure, who blamed the "Benadryl challenge."</p>
<p>"This needs to stop taking our kids or putting them in the hospital," she wrote.</p>
<p>KFOR's reporting, however, leaves out any attribution and does not provide any actual comments from her family about the girl's death. KFOR interviewed Scott Schaeffer, director of the <a href="https://oklahomapoison.org/">Oklahoma Center for Poison and Drug Information</a>, who explained to reporter Cassandra Sweetman how consuming large amounts of Benadryl can cause heart problems and seizures along with those hallucinations.</p>
<p>One might read Sweetman's story and assume, then, that Schaeffer knew about what happened with Phillips and was doing his job informing the public. That assumption, however, would be incorrect. Schaeffer subsequently told <em>Reason</em> that he actually had no direct knowledge about the incident KFOR reported.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in an email, Schaeffer said, "[U]pon review of our records, [we] have found no cases that appear to have been inspired by the 'Benadryl Challenge.'"</p>
<p>Sweetman has not responded to an email from <em>Reason</em> seeking attribution for the girl's death and the circumstances behind it.</p>
<p>That there's very little evidential attribution that a teen girl in Oklahoma actually died as a result of a TikTok video hasn't stopped the story from going viral. And each story's sole example of this "trend" points to the same overdoses of the teens in Fort Worth and videos that TikTok has already removed. (A company representative <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/09/02/teen-dies-after-doing--tiktok-benadryl-challengeas-doctors-warn-of-dangers/#33ac8464f0db">told</a> <em>Forbes</em> they're keeping an eye out for any new videos that might get posted.)</p>
<p>This is not a "trend." It is, however, an easy way for media outlets to sow another round of panic and paranoia over social media and to convince stressed out parents that new technologies pose a danger to their kids.</p>
<p>While it's true that there have been a small number of videos on TikTok encouraging Benadryl abuse, and that three teens in Texas decided to try it, there is very little evidence that a "Benadryl challenge" is something young people are doing (note the lack of actual links to TikTok videos in all this coverage), and so far, it's unclear whether a teen in Oklahoma City actually died as a result of it.</p>
<p>What is true is that many, many media outlets have decided to use a deleted Facebook post as factual evidence of a widespread pandemic of teens deliberately attempting to overdose on allergy medication.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2018, Florida schools saw a hiring surge for police officers. As a result, a new <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/expanding-presence-law-enforcement-florida-schools">study</a> says, the number of school arrests—which had been declining for years—suddenly started to rise. There was also a sharp increase in the use of physical restraint against students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The presence of law enforcement in schools was related to increases in the number of behavioral incidents reported to the state, the number of such incidents reported to law enforcement, and student arrests," the report says. "The results suggest a need to reconsider whether law enforcement should be present in schools, and, if they are, how they can be implemented in a way that minimizes unnecessary exposure of students to law enforcement and arrests."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The study</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> was conducted by F. Chris Curran, director of the Education Policy Research Center at the University of Florida. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> comes as school districts across the country, reponding to demands for policing reforms, are </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/06/25/major-cities-wrestle-with-proposals-to-end-school-policing/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reconsidering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the use of school resource officers (SROs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Florida in particular has rapidly increased the number of police patrolling its school hallways in the last two years. After the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, the state legislature passed a law requiring every K–12 school in the state to have a police officer or armed guardian. The law more than doubled the number of SROs in Florida schools. The majority of those new hires were assigned to elementary schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Florida has also been the site of several recent viral videos of small children being arrested. Last month, body camera footage </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/11/video-key-west-police-arrest-and-try-to-handcuff-8-year-old-child/"><span style="font-weight: 400">emerged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> showing officers in Key West, Florida, trying and failing to handcuff an eight-year-old boy, whose wrists were too small for the cuffs. An Orlando SRO made headlines last September when he </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/02/25/video-orlando-cops-arrest-crying-six-year-old-girl/"><span style="font-weight: 400">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a six-year-old girl. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Reason</span></i> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/06/08/floridas-school-resource-officers-police-reform-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in June, civil liberties groups and disability advocates have been warning that the hiring surge has led to a disturbing number of arrests of children. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The new study bears out at least some of their concerns. It found that the presence of SROs "predicted greater numbers of behavioral incidents being reported to law enforcement, particularly for less severe infractions and among middle schoolers." While overall youth arrests in the state declined by 12 percent, the number of youth arrests at school increased 8 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The study reported that police arrested elementary-aged children 345 times during the 2018–2019 school year. It also found four times as many incidents of physical restraint in 2018–2019 as there were in the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> have long contended that SROs contribute to the "school-to-prison pipeline" and lead to more arrests and harsher discipline, especially against minority students and students with disabilities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The study found that the increase in arrests was mostly attributable to increases in arrests of white students, while arrests of black students continued to decrease, though blacks are still disproportionately represented among student arrests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The study's conclusions broadly track with </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/20/study-more-cops-in-schools-lead-to-harsher-discipline-dont-make-school-safer/"><span style="font-weight: 400">recent findings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by researchers at the University of Maryland and the firm Westat, who studied several dozen middle and high schools in California and found that that increasing the number of SROs led to both immediate and persistent increases in the number of drug and weapon offenses and the number of suspensions and expulsions of students.</span></p>
<p>The SPLC and ACLU are calling on the state to repeal the 2018 law mandating SROs in every school.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Florida is failing to meet the needs of its students," Michelle Morton of the Florida ACLU said in a <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/presscenter/new-study-reveals-floridas-school-policing-mandate-has-increased-negative-outcomes">press release</a>. "The security measures implemented by our state due to the fear of mass shootings have created school environments that are not conducive to learning."</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FILM!" is a cry you hear incessantly at protests in Portland, Oregon, always shouted at close range to your face by after-dark demonstrators. You can assert that, yes, you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> film; you can point out that they themselves are filming incessantly; you can push their hands away from covering your phone; you can have your phone record them stealing your phone—all of these things have happened to me—and none will have any impact on their contention that "YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FILM" and its occasional variation, "PHOTOGRAPHY EQUALS DEATH!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cannot say who came up with these anti-camera battle cries. But it's easy to understand why protesters use them: to shape the narrative the country sees about the protests. And that narrative, in my estimation after many weeks covering street clashes in a city where I lived for 15 years, is 90 percent bullshit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered, the first time I attended the protests at the federal building back in July, who all these young people with PRESS emblazoned on their jackets or helmets were. I asked one such guy who he worked for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Independent Press Corps," he told me. As it turned out, dozens of other young PRESS people happened to work for the same outfit, which I at first assumed was a fancy way of saying "I want to report stuff and stream it on my Instagram."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This turned out to be naive. The IPC is an organized group in league with the activists, and it is usually their footage you see streamed online and recycled on the news: mostly innocent protestors being harassed and beaten by police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police indeed have tear-gassed and beaten people; there has been brutality. It is equally true, but featured less prominently in the news coverage, that activists spend hours every night menacing and setting fires to police stations and other institutions: City Hall, Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters, and last week Mayor Ted Wheeler's apartment building (until he agreed to move out). With the PRESS crew recording part of the story and the "YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FILM!" crew harassing other journalists, the result can be a misleading view of the protests. It's a revolution via the cellphone video they allow you to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IPC and other documentarians who are deemed sympathetic to the activists' cause agree on certain principles. You do not show activists' faces. You only show activists in a defensive position: responding to, rather than inciting, violence. You enhance what can appear to be police brutality, e.g., activists defending themselves with homemade shields, often bearing the anarchist circle-A, against police. The shields are largely ineffective for personal defense, but extremely effective for optics, and that's precisely the point. If a member of the IPC is arrested, he or she </span><a href="https://twitter.com/PDocumentarians/status/1278458060130775040?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be protected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporters seen as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sufficiently sympathetic to the cause—which is defined by the </span><a href="https://www.tenforjustice.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Demands for Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and includes most notably the abolition of the police—will be followed, be harassed, have their notes photographed and their phones blocked or stolen. (All these things have happened to me in the last month. A photographer friend has been repeatedly doxxed and placed on a list of "enemies.")</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you forget any of these rules, you can just refer to the handy </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSus2TGVTY9xek0ySPzLEiSUbPc8Z7vvWA5w6mInVgMfrTCrWmncvzAqScbc-39KZm8wVUVtNjhS5vR/pubhtml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google spreadsheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of approved journalists and suggested behavior. The spreadsheet contains names, Twitter handles, and ways to financially support the journos who make the cut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note who the people on this activist-approved list are writing for. Sergio Olmos, who made IPC's list of approved journalists,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/portland-protests.html">freelancing</a> as a man on the ground for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.* Freelancer</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Evans, whose early tick-tock of events on the ground I have admired, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/iwriteok/status/1284793130114445317?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on July 19 that the burning of the Portland Police Association was "the single biggest win so far." When questioned why, he replied that protesters have been "tear-gassed and beaten" for weeks. Unmentioned in his tweets: Protesters have been setting fire to the building for hours on many </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/17/a-quiet-night-in-portland/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nights throughout the summer</span></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a police response materializes. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/iwriteok/status/1284793130114445317"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8083204 size-full" src="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/09/image1.png" alt="" width="344" height="444" data-credit="Nancy Rommelmann" srcset="https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/09/image1.png 344w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/09/image1-232x300.png 232w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">These protester-approved journalists are producing much of the news you see about the protests, with an assist from the national press. Kate Shepherd isn't on the list, but she was previously a sympathetic reporter for local Portland media, and she is now filing such stories for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with headlines like "</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/10/portland-demetria-hester-arrest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portland police arrest a hate crime survivor and Wall of Moms organizer in crackdown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Portland has become a political football, with Donald Trump essentially running his presidential campaign against Democratic mayors like Wheeler, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1300170578134003713?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that "Portland will never recover with a fool for a Mayor. He tried mixing with the Agitators and Anarchists and they mocked him. He would like to blame me and the Federal Government for going in, but he hasn't seen anything yet. We have only been there with a small group to defend our U.S. Courthouse, because he couldn't do it." Both sides are getting their information through purposely bottlenecked media reports, and the results are predictably distorted and dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will not be quiet in Portland this weekend. Last night self-professed antifa supporter Michael Reinoehl was shot to death as the authorities tried to arrest him for </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/01/when-a-killing-becomes-a-rorschach-test-dispatch-from-portland/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killing Patriot Prayer member Aaron Danielson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Reinoehl claimed in an </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7g8vb/man-linked-to-killing-at-a-portland-protest-says-he-acted-in-self-defense"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it was self-defense.) It's going to be 100 degrees in the city. As we move into what is shaping to be the hottest weekend thus far in Portland, it's important to understand how the coverage you are getting is being shaped, and by whom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2018, the town of Gibraltar, Wisc., banned food trucks after a family started vending on their own property outside their store. After IJ challenged that ban, the town replaced </span><span style="font-weight: 400">it with a new ordinance prohibiting food trucks from areas where brick-and-mortar restaurants operate. Unconstitutional economic protectionism? This week we got our answer: "</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I can reach no other conclusion than these ordinances look, swim, and quack like efforts to unfairly discriminate against mobile food establishments in favor of brick-and-mortar restaurants in downtown Fish Creek in the Town of Gibraltar."

So there's that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Members of New York's 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Street Gang, seeking revenge on rival 7</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Street Gang, gather guns and go looking for trouble. Shooting breaks out and two innocent bystanders are killed. A member of the gang—convicted of aiding and abetting the murders by lending a .44 caliber handgun to another member—challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him. </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/18-421_amd_opn.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Second Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: And he wins. It's undisputed that the .44 malfunctioned and didn't fire. No </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">actus reus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, no crime.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Syrian man is involuntarily conscripted into the militia, where he undergoes basic training, performs guard duty, and does errands for superior officers. He flees to the United States, where he seeks asylum on the ground that he will be tortured if returned to Syria. Feds: We consider the government militia you were forced to join to be a terrorist organization, and we don't grant asylum to terrorists. </span><a href="https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/171176p.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Third Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: That's right. (Fortunately, he received a more restrictive "deferral of removal" under the Convention Against Torture.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Does New Jersey's ban on large capacity magazines violate the Second Amendment? </span><a href="https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/193142p.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Third Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: We already decided that it does not when we denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, so we're bound by the law of the case and cannot reconsider. Dissent: Prudential doctrines shouldn't trump constitutional rights.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/201012p.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Third Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: Pennsylvania man, who is African American, provides a ride home to a woman who states she is afraid of her drunk, abusive boyfriend. And with good reason. Upon arrival, the boyfriend hurls racial epithets, brandishes a knife, threatens to "chop up" the girlfriend, and jumps on the hood of the moving car. The terrified driver calls 911, who instruct him to convey his interior/exterior passengers to a police checkpoint. Naturally, the driver is arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, despite passing a breathalyzer test, and is charged with multiple&hellip;y'know what, just grab a stiff drink and read the case.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Does keeping a death-row inmate in solitary confinement for 33 years violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment? </span><a href="https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/183505p.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Third Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: Going forward? Yes. But qualified immunity in this case.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/183188p.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Third Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: Porno Producers Partially Prevail in Push to Prevent Paperwork Penalties</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Here's one for the procedure nerds: Partnership sues several pharmaceutical companies as a qui tam relator under the False Claims Act. When one of the partners leaves, that change amounts to the creation of a new partnership. Is the lawsuit now barred by the Act's first-to-file bar, which prevents a new person from intervening or bringing a related action? </span><a href="https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/182472p.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Third Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: Clever, but no.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Salvadoran man seeks asylum, alleging that if he is sent back to El Salvador, he will be killed by MS-13 because his sister refused to date a local gang leader. </span><a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/191591.P.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fourth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span><b> "</b><span style="font-weight: 400">Like offensive linemen on a football team, standards of review are not glamorous or exciting. But that does not mean they are unimportant.</span><b>" </b><span style="font-weight: 400">And under the "substantial evidence" standard, this guy is hosed.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Dissent: With their "nonsensical" and "cursory" analysis below, "the agencies left their blind side wide open."</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">The City of Austin allows digitized billboards for "on-premises signs," i.e., signs that advertise stuff at the locale of the sign, but prohibits digitization of "off-premises signs." Is this a content-based distinction that violates the First Amendment? </span><a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/19/19-50354-CV0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fifth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: It is, notwithstanding Justice Alito's suggestion in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Reed v. Town of Gilbert</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that such distinctions are content neutral.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/19/19-30609-CR0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fifth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: "The United States prosecuted and convicted Thaddeus Beaulieu for felony criminal contempt. The Government concedes that it committed prosecutorial misconduct but asks us to affirm Beaulieu's conviction anyway. We refuse and instead vacate the judgment."</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Maximum Security finished first at the 145</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> running of the Kentucky Derby, but his owners came home without the $1.5 million prize. Racing stewards disqualified the horse for interference. </span><a href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/20a0284p-06.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sixth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: Although the racing stewards are appointed by a government agency, we need not decide whether the procedures they applied comported with due process. The owners had no protected property interest in a prize they had not yet won.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">When an interaction between Black Hebrew Israelites, a Native American activist, and a group of high school students became the story of the hour, Representative Debra Haaland and Senator Elizabeth Warren Fired off some tweets. Almost two years later, the </span><a href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/20a0293p-06.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sixth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> affirmed the dismissal of the students' defamation claims. Because the Congresswomen tweeted their tweets in the course of their government employment, they are protected by sovereign immunity.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no dispute that the defendant—a Catholic school—would be protected from suit by the First Amendment if it had simply fired the plaintiff because of his sexual orientation. But does the First Amendment bar the plaintiff's claim that the school subjected him to a hostile working environment? No, holds the </span><a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2020/D08-31/C:19-2142:J:Flaum:dis:T:fnOp:N:2572335:S:0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Seventh Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, reasoning that religious employers can control their employees through hiring and firing decisions and need not subject them to abuse.</span><span style="background-color: transparent"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Tennessee man, unhappy to discover the Red Cloud Indian School is Catholic, posts a video to YouTube (and sends it to a school administrator) showing him taking a large, machete-like knife to the throat of a stuffed frog and saying he was coming to clean house. He then packs his truck with a machete, handgun, and a 5-foot-long samurai sword and drives the 1,000 miles to the South Dakota school. He's arrested in the parking lot, convicted of a weapons offense. Sentencing guidelines say 18–24 months; he's sentenced to 60 months. </span><a href="https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/20/09/192272U.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eighth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: Which is fine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Pro tip from the </span><a href="https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/20/09/192951P.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eighth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: If you wish to appeal a two-year injunction enforcing a non-compete clause, be sure to try to stay the order so your case doesn't become moot while your appeal is pending.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Allegation: TSA screener at Minneapolis–St. Paul airport manhandles man on crutches, causing him to fall and get injured. Can the man sue for battery and negligence? </span><a href="https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/20/08/183137P.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eighth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (over a dissent): Yes. TSA screening personnel qualify as "investigative or law enforcement officers" under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which means no sovereign immunity and the man's suit can go forward. (Circuit split watch: The en banc </span><a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/153047pen.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Third Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> agrees, the </span><a href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/files/201314053.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eleventh Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> disagrees.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Four men are convicted of sending $10k to a Somali terrorist group. The feds had tapped one of the men's phones pursuant to a warrant that relied on info from an NSA program collecting phone metadata in bulk (a program Edward Snowden made public and the NSA </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/11/28/snowden-effect-in-action-nsa-authority-to-collect-bulk-phone-metadata-expires/"><span style="font-weight: 400">no longer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> has authority to use). </span><a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/09/02/13-50572.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ninth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: There are significant Fourth Amendment concerns here, and the bulk metadata collection violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But we won't suppress the evidence, and we will affirm the convictions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Apple retail-store employees must undergo exit searches at the end of their shifts, which usually take 5–20 minutes to wait for and undergo. Which is time they must be paid for, according to the </span><a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/09/02/15-17382.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ninth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Parents of Hindu children in the California public schools claim that the 6th and 7th grade curricula discriminate against Hinduism. For example, they refer to a sacred text as an important piece of literature in Ancient India and describe Hinduism as a "culture that emerged as a belief system." </span><a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/09/03/19-15607.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ninth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: The materials "reflect careful crafting &hellip; to achieve a balanced portrayal of different world religions." No constitutional violations here.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Do speakers have a right to speak from traffic medians? </span><a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/19/19-6008.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tenth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: Yes! Concurrence: But maybe not if the median is really narrow.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">University officials: Sure, the plaintiff alleges that we falsely ginned up charges that got him indicted for racketeering, but those charges were dismissed as time barred. He can only sue for malicious prosecution if he beat the charges on the merits! </span><a href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201911719.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eleventh Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: No, we're pretty sure he can sue for malicious prosecution anyway.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Two-thirds of this </span><a href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201911921.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eleventh Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> panel agrees that the Eighth Amendment allows prison officials to take into account the fact that a new Hepatitis C treatment is "really expensive" when deciding whether all prisoners with Hep C will get it immediately.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Can the son of the former Prime Minister of Albania show a book's author and publisher had actual malice in depicting him as connected to the "Albanian mafia" as part of a wild story of gun-running later made into a Jonah Hill movie? No way (or, as the Albanians say, jo aspak), says the </span><a href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201910315.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eleventh Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, in part because of "the many prior published reports" making similar allegations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">An Alabama man's attempt to bring a stray dog to a shelter without showing anyone his ID turns into a melee with police officers, multiple tasings, and a final, surprise gunshot. A "gothic story," says the </span><a href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201815071.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Eleventh Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, in which qualified immunity is unwarranted.</span></li>

        <p>An anti-gun initiative in Washington, D.C., that was backed by Mayor Muriel Bowser is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-crackdown-on-gun-crime-targeted-black-wards-was-not-enforced-citywide-as-announced/2020/09/03/f6de0ce2-e933-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html">attracting criticism</a> because it has focused on predominantly black parts of the city. The controversy over the program, which prosecutes residents for violating the federal ban on firearm possession by people with felony records, illustrates the tension between two major items on the progressive agenda: strengthening gun control and reducing racial disparities in law enforcement. Those goals are hard to reconcile because enforcing firearm laws has a disproportionate impact on African Americans.</p>
<p>Originally that was by design. Modern gun control laws <a href="https://reason.com/1985/12/01/gun-control/">have their roots</a> in Southern states' efforts to disarm freedmen, depriving them of a constitutional right that Chief Justice Roger Taney, author of the Supreme Court's infamous 1857 decision in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/60us393"><em>Dred Scott v. Sandford</em></a>, warned black people would enjoy if they were recognized as citizens.</p>
<p>More recently, fear of armed black men has driven white politicians to support new gun restrictions. California's <a href="https://reason.com/2014/06/17/when-the-nra-opposed-open-carry/">Mulford Act</a>, a 1967 law backed by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan (and the National Rifle Association), responded to the rise of the Black Panthers by banning the open carrying of loaded firearms. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0883270161/reasonmagazinea-20/"><em>The Saturday Night Special</em></a><em>, </em>a 1973 book by investigative journalist Robert Sherrill, the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, passed at a time when politicians were alarmed by urban riots, aimed to "shut off weapons access to blacks, and since [legislators] probably associated cheap guns with ghetto blacks and thought cheapness was peculiarly the characteristic of imported military surplus and the mail-order traffic, they decided to cut off these sources while leaving over-the-counter purchases open to the affluent."</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-82/pdf/STATUTE-82-Pg1213-2.pdf#page=4">law</a> included prohibitions on gun sales to and purchases by several broad classes of people, including anyone who had been convicted of "a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year," meaning almost all felonies. The current <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">federal ban</a>, which applies to possession as well as sales and purchases, carries a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">penalty</a> of up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the D.C. Code, which also <a href="https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/22-4503.html">prohibits</a> gun possession by people who have been convicted of felonies, is even more severe, prescribing the same maximum penalty along with a mandatory minimum of one year. If the felony was violent, the maximum penalty is 15 years and the mandatory minimum is three years. But according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Felon_In_Possession_FY18.pdf">average federal sentence</a> for "felon in possession of a firearm offenders" is 64 months. Some of those defendants got enhanced penalties under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">applies</a> to offenders with three prior convictions. But even excluding those defendants, the average sentence was nearly five years.</p>
<p>The decision to charge defendants in federal court, which in D.C. is made by Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin, therefore exposes them to "harsher penalties compared to similar convictions in local court," <em>The Washington</em> <em>Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-crackdown-on-gun-crime-targeted-black-wards-was-not-enforced-citywide-as-announced/2020/09/03/f6de0ce2-e933-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html">notes</a>. So when it turns out that black defendants are especially likely to be charged in federal court, progressives tend to get upset.</p>
<p>Bowser, who is herself African American, presumably was not driven by racial animus when she backed the D.C. initiative, which aims to reduce gun crimes by disarming and locking up people thought likely to commit them. But the racially disproportionate results were predictable, since <a href="https://news.uga.edu/total-us-population-with-felony-convictions/">one-third</a> of African-American men have felony records (compared to 8 percent of the general population) and police and prosecutors were apt to concentrate on high-crime, predominantly black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>That is what happened, as federal prosecutors recently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-crackdown-on-gun-crime-targeted-black-wards-was-not-enforced-citywide-as-announced/2020/09/03/f6de0ce2-e933-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html">acknowledged</a>. Instead of targeting illegal gun owners throughout the city, as originally advertised, the program has focused entirely on three police districts that overlap with <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/04000US11-district-of-columbia/">Ward 5</a>, which is 64 percent black; <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/61000US11007-ward-7-dc/">Ward 7</a> (92 percent black); and <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/61000US11008-ward-8-dc/">Ward 8</a> (89 percent black). By comparison, blacks represent <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/04000US11-district-of-columbia/">44 percent</a> of the District's total population.</p>
<p>The program "exclusively—and now we know, by design—targets District residents of color via specific police districts," D.C. Council Member Charles Allen <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-crackdown-on-gun-crime-targeted-black-wards-was-not-enforced-citywide-as-announced/2020/09/03/f6de0ce2-e933-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html">complained</a> in a press release. "It is one more policy defaulting to harsh penalties on Black residents whose neighborhoods have historically been underinvested in and overpoliced. We must end this policy. It is taking us in the wrong direction."</p>
<p>D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, an elected official who enforces the D.C. Code, was likewise appalled by the "discriminatory application" of federal gun charges. According to the <em>Post,</em> D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said "he was unaware the initiative was being implemented in only certain parts of the District."</p>
<p>Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney, "criticized the program as implemented, saying he began a review when he took over the office in May and ended the program's geographic focus last week." While denying that the program is racially discriminatory, Sherwin said the "most equitable" approach would to make prosecutorial decisions based on each defendant's criminal history, including prior gun charges and convictions for violent crimes, rather than the neighborhood where he happened to be arrested. The program, Sherwin said, should be "designed to charge the most violent offenders with the most significant federal charges."</p>
<p>While a ban on gun possession by "violent offenders" might make sense, assuming their crimes were recent enough to suggest they still pose a threat to public safety, both the federal and D.C. laws sweep much more broadly than that. People convicted of violent crimes long ago—a youthful bar fight, say—can still be prosecuted for felonies if they keep guns for self-defense. And people convicted of nonviolent felonies, including drug offenses, also lose their Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that one-third of black males in the United States have felony records, this policy permanently deprives 7 million African-American men of the constitutional right to armed self-defense—a right that is especially important in neighborhoods like the ones federal prosecutors have been targeting in D.C.—even when they pose no plausible danger to the general public. Within the District, we are talking about something like 150,000 black men who, should police catch them with a firearm, could be sent to prison for a year if they are prosecuted in D.C. court or five years if if they are prosecuted in federal court.</p>
<p>Is every one of these men a menace to public safety? Sherwin implicitly concedes that the vast majority are not. But the distinction between the unauthorized gun owners who should go to federal prison and the unauthorized gun owners who should not rests entirely in his hands. D.C. residents who illegally arm themselves for self-protection just have to put their faith in his ability to identify "the most violent offenders."</p>
<p>This is what gun control looks like in practice. When the New York Police Department tried to reduce violent crime by stopping pedestrians, questioning them, and patting them down for weapons, the <a href="https://reason.com/2012/02/14/nypd-stops-have-septupled-under-bloomber/">overwhelming majority</a> of the people subjected to such treatment were black or Hispanic. And when they were frisked, which happened <a href="https://reason.com/2012/02/14/nypd-stops-have-septupled-under-bloomber/">about half</a> the time, police <a href="https://reason.com/2020/02/26/bloomberg-rewrites-his-history-of-doggedly-defending-stop-and-frisk/">almost never found guns</a> and rarely discovered weapons of any kind. That track record contradicted the pretense that the pat-downs were based on the "reasonable suspicion" that the Supreme Court <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/392/1.html">says</a> the Fourth Amendment requires. But according to Michael Bloomberg, a leading gun control advocate who was New York's mayor when these stops <a href="https://reason.com/2012/02/14/nypd-stops-have-septupled-under-bloomber/">skyrocketed</a>, the whole point was not to find guns but to <a href="https://reason.com/2012/05/11/bloomberg/">deter young men</a> from carrying them to begin with.</p>
<p>Given these realities, it is more than a little puzzling that people who are concerned about racial disparities, potentially deadly police encounters, and the life obstacles created by felony records would advocate new gun controls and stronger enforcement of existing restrictions. If you worry about those problems, why support policies that are bound to make them worse?</p>

<p>Instead of going after actual sexual predators, some police officers have discovered that it's easier to just trick people. These cops go on adult dating sites, pose as grown women, find lonely guys, flirt, and then claim they are actually underage. The photos they send of "themselves" depict real women in their 20s. When the mark arranges a date, the cops arrest him as a predator.</p>
<p>These stings are the subject of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/magazine/sex-offender-operation-net-nanny.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/magazine/sex-offender-operation-net-nanny.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599245178815000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnF06pmaWZZBJQCjWXvg856Q3AtA">a remarkable piece in <em>The New York Times</em> <em>Magazine</em></a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-winerip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-winerip&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599245178815000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYgObYg5mYA4c6JC653dn5r5VfuQ">Michael Winerip</a>. He begins by profiling 20-year-old Jace Hambrick, a young man living at home, working in construction and doing a lot of gaming in Vancouver, Washington. When Hambrick found "Gamer Gurl" on Craigslist (which requires users to be 18) he couldn't believe his luck: A woman who professed to love gaming and was looking for a boyfriend. They chatted for awhile and then "Gamer Gurl" said she was actually 13.</p>
<p>"Why did you post an ad in craigslist if your 13? You mean 23?" asked Hambrick.</p>
<p>They emailed, then texted, and she eventually shared a photo of herself. She looked like she was in her late teens or early 20s, she made cultural references most 13-year-olds wouldn't get, and she gave Hambrick driving directions to her home. When he arrived, the person who greeted him was the same woman from the picture. But when he entered the home, two cops handcuffed him. The beautiful young woman was an adult police officer.</p>
<p>Hambrick was sentenced to 18-months-to life, and a minimum of 10 years on the sexual offense registry. (The "to-life" part is real: The state reserves the right to keep extending the sentence indefinitely.)</p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Times </em>article explains that cops have arrested 300 men over the past four years via what the Washington state police dubbed "Operation Net Nanny." Many end up serving more time than men convicted of actually raping real kids. The disconnect between their "crime" and the fact no flesh-and-blood child was actually ever in danger—nor were the men looking for under-age partners—does not seem to matter to the cops.</p>
<p>Yet a state police captain giddily described the stings as an amazing return on investment:</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>
<p>"Plea bargains start at 10 years in prison. Compared to other criminal cases that can take a year or longer, may result in a few years in prison, costs hundreds of man-hours and still only result in a single arrest, this is a significant return on investment. Mathematically, it only costs $2,500 per arrest during this operation! Considering the high level of potential offense, there is a meager investment that pays huge dividends."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>
<p>Apparently sending people away for the longest possible time, not actually protecting the public, is the goal.</p>
<p>That the "meager investment" means locking away chumps who bit the confusing bait of a middle-aged male cop posing as a 20-something female cop posing as a 13-year-old female gamer, well, who cares? Think of the "dividends."</p>
<p>Winerip's article also details the cozy relationship between the police and a non-profit ostensibly dedicated to saving children from trafficking: Operation Underground Railroad. OUR, as it's called, donated more than $170,000 to the Washington police to support these stings. These funds "paid for additional detectives, hotels, food and overtime." Seemingly in return, the police helped the organization reap positive publicity. And of course, the more predators the cops catch, the more people are eager to donate to an organization focused on this scourge.</p>
<p>They must donate generously. OUR's founder, Tim Ballard, earned $343,000 in 2018. The fact that his organization supports a police operation that doesn't help any real child victims and seems to create predators out of lonely men falling for fictional characters? Details, details. Think of the dividends!</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hispanic parents, like other parents, have concerns about sending their kids back to school. According to a </span><a href="https://www.latinorebels.com/2020/08/28/latinoparentspoll/"><span style="font-weight: 400">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Latino Decisions, a firm founded by a Biden campaign operative, 59 percent of Hispanic households are "very concerned" that their kids could be exposed to the coronavirus at school; 52 percent expect to have technical troubles with online learning, 34 percent do not have access to high-speed Wi-Fi, and 36 percent "do not have anyone who can stay home" to supervise their children's online classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the data points to real difficulties for Hispanic families, the firm's proposed solution amounts to the usual big-government formulas that can exacerbate problems instead of solving them. Angela Gutierrez, an analyst at Latino Decisions, </span><a href="https://www.latinorebels.com/2020/08/28/latinoparentspoll/"><span style="font-weight: 400">writes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the survey shows the need for more federal and state school funding, "so that students and teachers can make the most out of teaching and learning in this unique situation."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as higher health care spending per capita has not always translated into a better response to the pandemic, higher spending in education does not necessarily mean better results. According to the Reason Foundation's Corey DeAngelis, the U.S. </span><a href="https://reason.org/commentary/inflation-adjusted-k-12-education-spending-per-student-has-increased-by-280-percent-since-1960/"><span style="font-weight: 400">spends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> $15,424 per child in the school system every year. Injecting more money into centralized school bureaucracies won't do much in itself to help working Hispanic parents who can't watch over their kids as they learn from home, or who can't afford the technological costs of remote schooling. But funding the families directly and letting them choose the schools their children attend could be a game changer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Private and charter schools have </span><a href="https://reason.com/2020/07/17/private-schools-are-adapting-to-lockdown-better-than-the-public-school-monopoly/"><span style="font-weight: 400">adapted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> better to distance learning during the pandemic than their district-run counterparts, the data suggests. A survey by </span><a href="https://www.educationnext.org/what-american-families-experienced-when-covid-19-closed-their-schools/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ipsos Public Affairs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> found that, in terms of the introduction of new content, parent satisfaction, and weekly contact with teachers, private and charter schools proved far nimbler in adjusting to the new reality than the public sector. According to a </span><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/pdfs/2020_surveymonkey-key-findings-toplines-teens-and-coronavirus.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Common Sense Media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> poll, 66 percent of privately educated children had "connected with their teacher once a day or more" versus only 31 percent of public school attendees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In part, this divide reveals how private sector innovators had advanced in distance learning long before the pandemic arose. For example, institutions such as cyber charter schools already had years of experience in delivering a fully online education to students. This is an ideal option for parents who might prefer online learning yet struggle with its financial or technological components. As the Commonwealth Foundation's Marc LeBlond </span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfoundation.org/issues/detail/getting-started-guide-to-cyber-school"><span style="font-weight: 400">writes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the case of Pennsylvania, the state's 15 cyber charter schools "provide all the required equipment for learning, plus a stipend for broadband internet access." And, contrary to the claim that such assistance requires more funding, charter schools in Pennsylvania receive </span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfoundation.org/policyblog/detail/understanding-cyber-charter-schools"><span style="font-weight: 400">27 percent less</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> per pupil on average than district-run schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The main obstacle to increased enrollment in cyber charter schools is not a lack of funding or insufficient demand from families. It is lobbying by teachers unions intent on using their political clout to avoid competition. This has been true not just in </span><a href="https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2020/04/how-pennsylvania-is-discouraging-education-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-opinion.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> but in </span><a href="https://fox40.com/news/california-connection/students-educators-sue-california-over-school-funding-changes-in-this-years-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, North Carolina, Alaska, and </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oregons-coronavirus-education-lockdown-11585697080"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, where 1,600 students were prevented in March from enrolling in a cyber charter school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And families who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> want their children to continue their educations in person? In several states with large Hispanic communities—California, Florida, Illinois—powerful teachers unions have opposed reopening schools in many districts. Sometimes that is linked to other items on the union agenda, as when the pressure group </span><a href="https://www.demandsafeschools.org/demands/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Demand Safe Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> calls for a "massive infusion of federal money to support the reopening" and a "moratorium on new charter and voucher programs and standardized testing."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet school choice programs are just what many Hispanic families need if they are to send their kids to good private or charter schools while brick-and-mortar academies remain closed. They could even ease fears about the coronavirus, since parents could choose schools with smaller class sizes and more stringent health measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Latino Decisions has identified some of the challenges that Hispanic families must overcome in these difficult times. But the solution is not to strengthen the centralized bureaucracies that run traditional public schools. Sen. Rand Paul (R–Ky.) has a better idea: the </span><a href="https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/dr-rand-paul-introduces-school-act-empower-parents-increase-education-options-and-flexibility"><span style="font-weight: 400">SCHOOL Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which would "allow federal funds for K-12 education to follow the eligible child, learning in person or remotely, to the school of their choice." That would go a long way toward giving Hispanic parents—and all parents—true power over their children's future.</span></p>

        <p><strong><em>Woke</em>. Available Wednesday, September 9, on <a href="https://www.hulu.com/welcome" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hulu.com/welcome&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599314915848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiQHX01a90W18GlQ0LT6BHydsO7g">Hulu.</a></strong></p>
<p>In a dreary age in which we're battered on one side by authentic police mayhem and on the other by puerile PC paladins, Hulu's new comedy series <em>Woke</em> is little short of a miracle. It manages to carefully and very funnily thread a needle through a political and social straitjacket.</p>
<p>Created by <a href="http://www.kchronicles.com/comic/illegal-drugs-in-sewage/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.kchronicles.com/comic/illegal-drugs-in-sewage/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599314915848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYjSssRG9YFvc92GzINxLwdRUhNw">cartoonist</a>-rapper-Michael-Jackson-impersonator Keith Knight and <em>Barbershop</em> screenwriter Marshall Todd, <em>Woke</em> is based (with a lot fewer hallucinations, I'm guessing; we'll get to those in a minute) on Knight's cartooning career.</p>
<p>His alter-ego is Keef Knight (Lamorne Morris, <em>New Girl</em>), who draws a strip called <em>Toast and Butter</em> for a dying and penniless local paper. But his life is looking up. "The last time you're going to see broke Keef Knight," he brags to his roommates as he heads off to sign a syndication deal that will launch him into big-league, big-money syndication.</p>
<p><em>Toast and Butter</em> is, by Knight's own description, "a comic strip about bored breakfast food," and he resents complaints that it's not politicized enough. "Why is it that people of color are always having to stand for something or say something in our work?" he snaps at one (black) editor. "You know, I'm just a cartoonist."</p>
<p>That changes abruptly when Knight is manhandled by (white) cops who mistake him for a mugging suspect. The aftermath: Inanimate objects spring to life to talk to him. Bottles. Mailboxes. Trashcans. His own cartoons. A lot of them agree with the editor and want him to weaponize his artwork, though not all of them are channeling Van Jones. Advises a bottle from a convenience-store beer cooler: "Did you know malt liquor makes black people impervious to bullets?"</p>
<p>The litany of street wisdom starts to alert Knight to some things he hasn't noticed, including that his new syndicate has noticeably lightened his skin in his publicity photo, and his (black) neighborhood barber has been replaced by (white) hipsters who charge 10 times as much but make everybody look like Russell Brand. One of Knight's roommates makes a quick diagnosis: "This nigga <em>woke</em>!"</p>
<p>The problem is that Knight's wokeness looks, to many people, more like craziness, particularly at his highly publicized appearance at a comic-book convention where, goaded on by mocking pens and pencils, he kickboxes with a big cardboard cutouts of himself and his characters even tries to eat them. Gifs of him screaming "Fuck toast and butter!" pop up all over the internet. Knight's career is over before it's begun. "You're gonna be turning tricks in the hay for vegan sliders," gleefully exclaims one of his hallucinations.</p>
<p>Knight the cartoonist's dawning awareness of a racism he's willfully ignored all his life is clearly the major thrust of <em>Woke</em>. But Knight the producer keeps his comedy from turning into a tirade by opening fire on any target of opportunity, particularly the affectations of white liberals. One hires him to come to a cocktail party so her friends can speak to an actual black person, touch his hair, snap selfies with him and introduce themselves with the breathless proclamation that "I don't think O.J. did it!"</p>
<p>Many of the comic balls are kept in the air by Knight's roommates, the (black) horndog hustler Clovis (Chicago comic T. Murph) and (white) professional sperm donor Gunther (Blake Anderson, <em>Workaholics</em>), who's also working to market cocaine as a powdered energy mix. Their sometimes goofball and sometimes cynical takes on Knight's troubled new consciousness are flat-out hilarious. When Knight, inspired by his experience as a paid attraction at the cocktail party, draws a strip titled "Black People For Rent," Clovis promptly puts it on T-shirts.</p>
<p>Knight is outraged. "Blackness should not be a commodity," he insists. Shrugs Clovis: "It's the <em>original</em> commodity." The ability to find that kind of humor in 2020 makes me think we may survive it yet.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fortunately, the N.Y. State Education Department has now reversed the decision, which had been made by the Valley Central School District (about 70 miles north of New York City).]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just read an interesting Aug. 19, 2020 opinion of N.Y. State Education Department Interim Commissioner Betty A. Rosa (just posted on Westlaw), <em><a href="http://www.counsel.nysed.gov/Decisions/volume60/d17913">Appeal of N.R</a>.</em> N.R. was an eight-grade student who was suspended for a month because of what he searched for on his school-issued computer and the key legal analysis:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Valley Central School District's] letter charged that, on or about November 19, 2018, the student "searched for inappropriate topics" on his school-issued computer (the "Chromebook"). The notice of charges for the long-term suspension hearing identified the following searches, which the district alleged were inappropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>What temperature does gasoline freeze at Fahrenheit;</li>
<li>worst WWI gun;</li>
<li>I will kill every drug addict;</li>
<li>funniest ways to die;</li>
<li>what's the sharpest knife;</li>
<li>nitroglycerin explosion;</li>
<li>is nitroglycerin really that unstable;</li>
<li>the fastest gun firing rate;</li>
<li>mother of all bomb explosion;</li>
<li>what is the sign that death is near;</li>
<li>is lidocaine legal; [and]</li>
<li>kill shot &hellip;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a written recommendation dated December 20, 2018, the hearing officer recommended that the student be found guilty of the "charged misconduct by making inappropriate searched on his school-issued Chromebook."</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-8083146"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>[1.] I agree with petitioner insofar as the district was limited to charging the student with misconduct for the specific search terms identified in the notice. At the hearing, certain search terms were discussed which were not listed within the written notice, such as "claymore" and "biggest european sword."</p>
<p>[2.] The district also implied at the hearing that the student violated district policy because some of his searches were unrelated to his schoolwork, rather than inherently inappropriate or violent in nature. The Commissioner has held that a district must be held to the language of the charges it chooses to pursue against a student. While it is unclear from the record if the hearing officer, superintendent, or respondent found the student guilty based upon any search terms that were not identified in the notice of charges, any such reliance would have been improper. Indeed, at the hearing, the middle school principal admitted as much when he indicated that the district chose not to charge the student with misconduct for certain search terms (<em>e.g.</em> "worst poker hand") that were not related to the student's academics.</p>
<p>[3.] Education Law §3214(3)(a) permits the suspension of "[a] pupil who is insubordinate or disorderly or violent or disruptive, or whose conduct otherwise endangers the safety, morals, health or welfare of others." &hellip; I cannot find that [the student's] searches violated either Education Law §3214 or the district policies identified in the notice of charges&hellip;.</p>
<p>I agree with respondent that several of the terms for which the student searched—<em>e.g.</em> "the fastest gun firing rate," "nitroglycerin explosion," and "kill shot"—appeared violent on their face and warranted further investigation. At the hearing, however, the student testified as to his underlying reasons for conducting the searches, and none of these reasons were violent in nature. For example, the student testified that he searched for "kill shot" because he was looking for the lyrics to a popular song titled "killshot."</p>
<p>Similarly, the student testified that he searched for "nitroglycerin explosion" because he wanted to understand how nitroglycerin can be used as a medication for heart conditions when it was also used as an explosive during the construction of the transcontinental railroad. Indeed, the student's search history revealed that he had also searched for "what was nitroglycerin used for?" in close proximity to the "nitroglycerin explosion" search. The district notably did not submit any evidence to rebut the student's testimony during the hearing. Thus, there is no evidence in the record establishing that the student posed an actual threat of violence or had any violent intent when conducting the internet searches listed in the notice of the charge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the record reflects that the student conducted the "hard reset" search on November 2, 2018, prior to the date upon which he engaged in the other search terms to which respondent objects. Thus, it could not have been performed, as respondent implies, to conceal the student's search history. Respondent did not otherwise explain how the "hard reset" search was improper, nor did it allege or prove that the search violated any district policy.</p>
<p>Moreover, respondent failed to prove by competent and substantial evidence that the mere act of searching for such terms—regardless of the student's intent—endangered the safety, morals, health, or welfare of others. The student's search history was only discovered after respondent decided to examine the student's Chromebook for reasons unrelated to student discipline. Notably, there is no evidence that the student informed anyone of his internet searches or that anyone at the school would have been aware of the student's search history if not for the district's review of such search history. Nor is there any evidence in the record that any students or faculty members became aware of the student's search history after the district's review of the student's Chromebook, except for those individuals involved in bringing the instant disciplinary charge against the student.</p>
<p>Thus, I find that the student's conduct, which was unknown prior to its discovery and which would not foreseeably cause any disruption to school operations or activities, was not conduct for which the district could properly suspend the student under Education Law §3214(3)(a).</p></blockquote>
<p>The analysis seems quite right to me. A school might be reasonable in doing some investigation based on such student searches, if it happens to learn about them—but not in simply suspending the student.</p>

        <p>New York City residents still dependent on public schools received good-ish news this week. The teachers' union—which <a href="https://www.uft.org/news/news-stories/uft-threatens-actions-if-unsafe-school-buildings-open">threatened to strike</a> unless the city met its demands for COVID-19 precautions—finally <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/627-20/mayor-de-blasio-chancellor-carranza-labor-reach-agreement-reopen-new-york-city-schools#/0">came to an agreement</a> with Mayor Bill de Blasio and Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza. Under the deal, union leaders get to say they protected their members' interests, while city officials get to claim that schools are safer than ever. And parents get to figure out what to do with their kids during unplanned days of idleness as the beginning of classes is <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/09/01/nyc-delays-reopening-of-public-schools">pushed back a week and a half</a>.</p>
<p>"Under the terms of the agreement, all New York City public school buildings will remain closed to students until Sept. 21, while final safety arrangements are completed, including the assignment of a school nurse to every building, ventilation checks and the presence of sufficient protective and cleaning supplies," <a href="https://www.uft.org/news/press-releases/uft-fact-sheet-on-school-opening-agreement">boasted</a> the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) labor union. "The decision on whether to reopen a building to students will be based on the UFT 50-item safety checklist, including social distancing of student desks, the availability of masks and face shields, and a room-by-room review of ventilation effectiveness."<del></del></p>
<p>"This is a great day for every public school student in New York City," <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/627-20/mayor-de-blasio-chancellor-carranza-labor-reach-agreement-reopen-new-york-city-schools#/0">insisted</a> de Blasio. "We face a return to school unlike any in our city's history, but New Yorkers have made it possible because of their extraordinary work fighting back COVID-19. Our agreement puts the health and safety of our 1.1 million students, teachers, and school staff above everything else."</p>
<p>The announcements resolved weeks of uncertainty for students and parents that saw the UFT <a href="https://www.uft.org/news/press-releases/uft-executive-board-authorizes-further-negotiation-strike-authorization-vote-possible-tomorrow-over">threatening to strike</a> as recently as the <em>day before</em> the deal was finalized. Families counting on the public schools for their children's education had no way to know if they were actually going to get any education in return for the $25,000 that New York City schools extract from taxpayers and <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/school-spending.html">spends per pupil</a> every year.</p>
<p>The UFT isn't alone in its brinksmanship. Unions from <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/09/01/battle-between-district-and-teachers-union-causing-uncertainty-days-before-sacramento-schools-start-class/">Sacramento</a>, California to <a href="https://www.wbur.org/edify/2020/09/01/andover-teachers-union-school-committee-coronavirus-reopening">Andover</a>, Massachusetts held up the reopening of government schools, overtly using kids as bargaining chips to extract concessions over working conditions.</p>
<p>The United Teachers of Los Angeles went further, <a href="https://wearepublicschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SameStormDIffBoats_FINAL.pdf">at one point</a> demanding wealth taxes, police reform, and a moratorium on charter schools as necessary preconditions for reopening public schools. The union settled for <a href="https://www.utla.net/news/utla-members-ratify-ta-95-yes">remote-only classes</a>.</p>
<p>Threatening strikes and <a href="https://www.jocombs.org/apps/news/article/1274796">refusing to show up for work</a> have been effective tactics so far, since there's a lot of leverage to be had in keeping parents uncertain as to the educational fate of their children, or even as to where they will spend the day while their parents work. But the labor actions have also created openings for education alternatives.</p>
<p>Private schools, learning pods, microschools, charters, and homeschooling approaches offer parents options that suit their preferences—options that can usually be adopted without waiting on the pleasure of third parties with their own agendas. With their public spats, last-minute agreements, and one-size-fits-few compromises government schools and teachers unions are handing unprecedented marketing opportunities to the competition.</p>
<p>"If your school in the Greater Boston area has a delayed opening or is going fully remote, check out our website to find a Catholic school near you that is offering live in-person instruction," <a href="https://twitter.com/CSOboston/status/1299380802724261893">tweeted</a> the Catholic Schools Office of the Archdiocese of Boston on August 28. "All are welcome—learn more today!"</p>
<p>"Do you know what you are doing for school this fall?" Prenda, which offers a model for microschools, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/prendalearn/videos/628503174709912">posted</a> on Facebook on August 27. "Join us to learn more about Prenda Family, our full-service at-home education program with a learning model, community, and curriculum that is designed to help your kids become empowered learners."</p>
<p>In other cases, parents tackle education with a DIY approach.</p>
<p>"Nobody working in education today can escape pandemic learning pods: the increasingly popular phenomenon in which families band together and hire a private tutor to offer in-person learning to a small group of children," <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/love-or-hate-them-pandemic-learning-pods-are-here-to-stay--and-could-disrupt-american-education/2020/09/02/3d359f8c-dd6f-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html">noted</a> this week.</p>
<p>Families that have neither the resources nor the inclination to pay tuition or a share of a tutor's fees are <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/07/once-marginalized-homeschooling-hits-the-mainstream/">taking on the task themselves</a> and discovering that education doesn't have to be expensive.</p>
<p>"Interest in homeschooling has 'exploded'," the Associated Press <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/education/2020/08/12/coronavirus-outbreak-homeschooling-virtual-learning/3353946001/">reports</a>. "Some are worried their districts are unable to offer a strong virtual learning program. For others who may have been considering homeschooling, concerns for their family's health amid the coronavirus and the on-again, off-again planning for in-person instruction are leading them to part ways with school systems."</p>
<p>Kids are increasingly being educated by their own relations, or in co-op style by groups of like-minded parents who share responsibilities for a pool of children.</p>
<p>The move by motivated families who can manage education alternatives even as they pay taxes for institutions plagued by squabbling amongst union leaders and government officials has some people <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/08/metro/families-with-means-leave-public-schools-private-schools-or-learning-pods-raising-concerns-about-worsening-educational-inequality/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link">worried about inequality</a>. Public schools are poised to become the Medicaid of learning—lower-quality government offerings of last resort.</p>
<p>If—<em>when</em>, more likely—that happens, education bureaucrats and union officials will have nobody to blame but themselves.</p>
<p>"Somewhere along the way, I believe we flipped the purpose of this," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told the <em>New York Daily News</em> editorial board during a <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/andrew-cuomo-rips-teacher-unions-selfish-industry-article-1.2089053">2015 discussion</a> about schools. "This was never a teacher employment program and this was never an industry to hire superintendents and teachers. This was a program to educate kids."</p>
<p>But, as Cuomo acknowledged, kids are beside the point when government officials and union leaders keep them waiting on negotiations that serve everybody but the people who depend on public schools. So families are leaving to explore the world beyond.</p>
<p>And as families grow accustomed to choosing what works for their children rather than accepting what they're given, fewer of them are going to be eager to return their kids to the roles of hostages in labor negotiations. If we're serious about educating <em>everybody</em>, all families should be allowed the freedom to do the same.</p>

        <p><strong>"Investigators haven't yet determined how many rounds were fired."</strong> A few hours after the release of a video outing himself as the person who fatally shot a Patriot Prayer protester in Portland, Oregon, last week, 48-year-old Michael Forest Reinoehl was himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/michael-reinoehl-arrest-portland-shooting.html">shot and killed</a> by police. The shooters were part of a federal task force that included U.S. marshals and FBI agents as well as local law enforcement, and they were there to take him in as a suspect in the August 29 slaying of 39-year-old Aaron "Jay" Danielson.</p>
<p>Reinoehl was "an Army veteran and father of two who has provided what he called 'security' at Black Lives Matter protests," <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7g8vb/man-linked-to-killing-at-a-portland-protest-says-he-acted-in-self-defense">reports</a> <em>Vice News</em>. Reinoehl told journalist Donovan Farley that he shot Danielson in self-defense, believing that Danielson was about to stab him and his friend.</p>
<p>"You know, lots of lawyers suggest that I shouldn't even be saying anything, but I feel it's important that the world at least gets a little bit of what's really going on," Reinoehl said on camera. "I had no choice. I mean, I, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn't going to do that."</p>
<p>Reinoehl "had described himself in a social media post as '100% ANTIFA,' and suggested the tactics of counter-protesters amounted to 'warfare,'" <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/slain-shooting-suspect-was-a-regular-at-portland-protests">notes</a> Seattle's KOMO. "He had been shot at one protest and cited for having a gun at another."</p>
<p>On Thursday night, Reinoehl allegedly pulled a gun on a team of federal agents who showed up to arrest him. "Initial reports indicate the suspect produced a firearm, threatening the lives of law enforcement officers," said the U.S. Marshals Service in a statement.</p>
<p>"Thurston County Sheriff's Lt. Ray Brady said four members of the fugitive task force fired their weapons, including two Pierce County Sheriff's deputies, an officer from the Lakewood Police Department and an officer from the Washington State Department of Corrections," <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/authorities-suspect-in-fatal-shooting-at-portland-protest-killed-by-officers-in-lacey">reports</a> KOMO. "Brady said investigators haven't yet determined how many rounds were fired."</p>
<hr />
<h2>FREE MINDS</h2>
<p><strong>The District of Columbia admits racist gun-law enforcement.</strong><em> The Washington Post </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-crackdown-on-gun-crime-targeted-black-wards-was-not-enforced-citywide-as-announced/2020/09/03/f6de0ce2-e933-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An initiative cracking down on gun crimes in the District targeted three predominantly Black wards and was not enforced citywide as announced, U.S. prosecutors acknowledged in court records, drawing attacks that the policy disproportionately subjected African American defendants to lengthier prison terms.</p>
<p>The geographic targeting of the program launched in February 2019—under which felons caught illegally possessing guns are charged under federal statutes—was recently disclosed after a defendant challenged the program backed by D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D).</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>FREE MARKETS</h2>
<p><strong>English tutors and teachers caught up in TikTok ban.</strong> Trump's executive order targeting ByteDance, the company behind popular video app TikTok, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/03/909322191/they-teach-chinese-kids-english-online-now-theyre-caught-in-trump-s-war-on-tikto">also hits the nearly 4,000 U.S. teachers</a> who teach English to Chinese children through the ByteDance-owned app GOGOKID.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/us-is-looking-at-banning-more-chinese-apps-over-national-security.html">considering banning even more apps</a> as part of the president's paranoid crusade against products from China. The administration says it's a matter of national security.</p>
<hr />
<h2>QUICK HITS</h2>
<p>• The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may start demanding biometric data from all immigration applicants. A new proposal at the agency "would give DHS the authority to require biometrics for every application, petition or related immigration request," <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/politics/dhs-expanded-biometric-collection-dna/index.html">reports</a> CNN, which notes that "currently, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the DHS agency responsible for managing immigration benefits, requires biometrics only for applications that require background checks."</p>
<p>• The Tax Foundation <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/more-act-federal-taxation-of-recreational-marijuana/">analyzes</a> the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which is scheduled to get a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives later this month.</p>
<p>• Jessica Krug, a professor of African-American history at George Washington University, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/03/jessica-krug-white-professor-pretended-black">just pretending to be black</a>.</p>
<p>• An array of anonymous sources in <em>The Atlantic</em> have tales to tell about Trump's alleged disrespect for the military and dead troops. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/">Make of them what you will</a>.</p>
<p>• Protesters are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kentucky-derby-expected-draw-demonstrators-demanding-answers-breonna-taylor-s-n1239155">heading</a> to the Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>• "Right under the nose of a president who promised to drain the swamp, one of the government's shadiest handouts to large banks and big companies looks like it will be renewed for another 25 years," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/opinion/pefco-export-import-bank.html">writes</a> <em>Reason</em> columnist Veronique de Rugy in <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>• Former Massachusetts governor and 2016 Libertarian Party vice presidential candidate Bill Weld is <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/514919-biden-picking-up-endorsements-from-nearly-100-republicans">endorsing Joe Biden</a>. According to <em>The Hill</em>, Weld joins "a group representing almost 100 former Republican lawmakers and officials" who want to see Trump defeated.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400">A few years ago, I blithely drove toward the Humboldt redwood forests across the <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/top-10-largest-wildfires-in-lake-county-since-2012/">coastal ranges</a> without checking the morning road updates. Let's just say that moving along in a small metal box with fires raging on both sides of Highway 20 gives one a new appreciation of the perilous work firefighters do to contain such blazes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">As another grueling fire season grips California, I understand growing concerns about a <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/21/how-short-is-california-on-firefighters/">widely reported</a> lack of firefighting resources. Although structure fires and, especially, paramedic calls comprise the bulk of calls to local fire departments, there's no question that arid California needs a boisterous system for battling blazes in its expansive forests. Wildfires are as predictable as the rising sun, but the state doesn't do a great job preparing for them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">"More than 930,000 acres have burned so far in Northern and Central California—an area larger than the land mass of Rhode Island—with little containment, in part because firefighting resources are stretched beyond capacity by the number of blazes," according to a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-22/california-short-on-firefighters-amid-biggest-blazes">report</a> last week in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. The Ocean State would barely make a decent-sized county here, but that's still an incredible amount of tinder.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The article <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-22/california-short-on-firefighters-amid-biggest-blazes">noted</a> that California officials have had to make "tough choices on which (wildfires) to fight" and that "officials said they were being turned down for state help and left to beg equipment and manpower from volunteers and local agencies." State officials have little choice but to allow some amazing forestlands, including redwood groves, to burn to the ground.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Most of the ongoing debates about firefighting center on broader environmental and regulatory issues. Predictably, climate-change activists blame global warming. "Temperatures rose about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit statewide while precipitation dropped 30 percent since 1980," according to a <em>Scientific American</em> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-has-doubled-riskiest-fire-days-in-california/#:~:text=Climate%20change%20has%20doubled%20the,precipitation%20dropped%2030%25%20since%201980.">article</a> in April about a Stanford University study. Researchers blame this heat rise for an increase in the days in which fire risk is at the highest.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Others blame California's forest-management policies. "It's not climate change that's burning up the forests, killing people, and destroying hundreds of homes; it's decades of environmental mismanagement that has created a tinderbox of unharvested timber, dead trees, and thick underbrush," <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2019/02/25/wildfires-caused-by-bad-environmental-policy-are-causing-california-forests-to-be-net-co2-emitters/#2ed37ae65e30">argued</a> former Orange County Assemblyman Chuck Devore in <em>Forbes</em> last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Still others say the state's heavily regulated insurance system, which <a href="https://www.rstreet.org/2019/01/04/hey-california-stop-encouraging-building-in-fire-zones/">limits</a> the ability of insurers to price fire policies at the market rate, subsidizes home construction in heavily wooded areas. There also are myriad disputes relating to electrical lines, and the liability laws that govern responsibility when those lines spark a wildfire. I'm more focused on a nuts-and-bolts governance problem—one that is standard fare with all government services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Because agencies are monopoly institutions, funded by tax proceeds and mandatory <a href="https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/fire-prev-fee.htm">fees</a>, they do a terrible job allocating the resources that they receive. In the private sector, companies that do a lousy job go out of business. In the public sector, agencies that perform poorly or inadequately lobby for more money—so they continue with <a href="https://californiapolicycenter.org/the-mystery-of-calfire/">business as usual</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, union power drives state and local firefighting policies. The median compensation package for firefighters has topped $240,000 a year in <a href="https://californiapolicycenter.org/firefighting-in-orange-county-part-one-firefighter-pay-and-benefits/">some locales</a>. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection firefighters earn less, but their packages still total nearly <a href="https://californiapolicycenter.org/napa-fires-highlight-huge-disparities-wealthy-firefighters-slave-laborers/">$150,000</a> a year. The number of California firefighters who receive compensation packages above $500,000 a year is <a href="https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/search/?q=Fire">mind-blowing</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Obviously, if the state spends scarce resources in this manner, it will have fewer resources to hire additional firefighters and buy equipment that's now in short supply. After one particularly bad fire season, an acquaintance told me that we should pay firefighters "anything." The state has indeed taken that approach, and look where it's gotten us. Meanwhile, 70 percent of the nation's firefighters, including in the town where I live, do this tough work on a <a href="https://www.govtech.com/em/disaster/EM-Summer-2017-Dwindling-Force.html">volunteer</a> basis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Any politician who tries to improve how firefighting services are provided, or to help communities get their raging compensation costs under control, runs up against a special-interest juggernaut that's as challenging as a three-alarm office fire. For instance, this newspaper group has <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/02/27/placentia-fire-reforms-spark-unhinged-retort/">detailed</a> the outrageous pushback that Placentia faced from chiefs and unions as it created a new department to provide better and less costly services for residents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Opponents cited safety concerns, but opposition was really about compensation given that Placentia's <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/07/02/placentias-new-fire-department-begins-service-with-ceremony-then-an-emergency-call/">model</a> offers a cost-saving—but generous—retirement plan and outsources paramedic services to a private company. Even as legislators bemoan the current resource problems, they recently supported, on a bipartisan basis, a union-backed pension bill (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2967">Assembly Bill 2967</a>) that effectively prohibits other cities from following Placentia's approach.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">We all appreciate the work that firefighters do, especially during another grueling fire season, but we shouldn't forget that firefighting resource shortages are caused by a <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/2019/09/ab5-impact-california-labor-comeback-organizing-federal-janus-law/">legislature</a> that is more interested in preserving union wage levels than in creating a firefighting system that works best for the public.</p>

        <p>Published in fall 2019, Sarah Pinsker's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Song-New-Day-Sarah-Pinsker-ebook/dp/B07L7TLT9G/ref=sr_1_1?crid=YXS55ELBZJTW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+song+for+a+new+day+sarah+pinsker&amp;qid=1597429946&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=a+song+for+a+n%2Cstripbooks%2C211&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=reasonmagazinea-20"><em>A Song for a New Day</em></a> is set in a near-future where public gatherings have been radically limited by a global pandemic and threats of violence. Reading the book in 2020—which I did shortly after learning it had won this year's Nebula Award—raises questions about the author's psychic abilities.</p>
<p>But there's much more to recommend the novel than just its eerie prescience. The story follows the hilariously named Rosemary Laws through a series of musical speakeasies, illegal under the political regime, as she scouts new acts on behalf of her corporate virtual reality employer. But an encounter with the equally hilariously named underground rock star Luce Cannon forces her to question the rules and regulations that have driven music—and so much else that makes life worth living—underground.</p>

        <p>Getting bottle service in a club surrounded by leggy, stilettoed models is sort of about sex—but it's mostly about status, explains sociologist Ashley Mears in her new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0824B49LS/reasonmagazinea-20/"><em>Very Important People</em></a>.</p>
<p>For those who don't dabble in the Miami-Manhattan-Ibiza club circuit, Mears' work uses ethnographic research, shadowing promoters and conducting interviews, to demystify how and why club promoters function as the link between aspiring models and wealthy clients. Mears knows this world from the inside, having embedded herself in the party circuit, trading her own attractiveness for research access.</p>
<p>She chronicles the subtle gradations in status present in the club ecosystem: Being a "paid girl"—a sex worker or cocktail waitress whose sexual services are presumed to be for sale—is frowned upon by the uncompensated "party girls," for instance. She also tries to follow the financial incentives, noting that the clubs reap profits from promoters' Rolodexes of attractive women, though she consistently discounts the ways in which the women themselves profit in the form of free food, booze, and stays in the Hamptons.</p>
<p>"Rituals of displaying and squandering wealth" have always intrigued anthropologists. Mears points to the <em>potlatch</em>, a competitive gift-giving ritual once common in Native American societies, to highlight the enduring nature of our tendency toward oneupmanship. The urge to be a "big man"—to amass power by being magnanimous, leaving people awed or indebted—seems ineradicable over time, though it takes different surface forms.</p>
<p>Not every rich person engages in public displays of wealth; depending on the culture, such behavior may even be frowned upon. Still, conspicuous consumption has a long pedigree, and Mears' effort to take readers behind the velvet rope proves both fun and sobering.</p>

Canada has closed its borders to U.S. travelers to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. It will allow U.S. residents to drive from the Lower 48 to Alaska, but they must take the most direct route and drive straight through. So when someone spotted his U.S. license plates at the park and reported him to cops, Pennington was arrested.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the White House issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-reviewing-funding-state-local-government-recipients-permitting-anarchy-violence-destruction-american-cities/">a memorandum</a> on cutting federal grants to "anarchist jurisdictions," by which they seem to mean local governments that don't pursue the sorts of aggressive law enforcement policies the administration favors. In and of itself, the memorandum is long on rhetoric condemning supposed "anarchy," but short on actual action.</p>
<p>It could be that the document is mostly a PR move intended to stoke Trump's base, and bolster the "law and order" theme of his presidential campaign. If the administration does end up actually trying to condition federal grants on adherence to the policies outlined in the memorandum, it would be yet another attack on federalism and separation of powers, similar to that resulting from <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3347171">Trump's attempts to deny federal grants to "sanctuary cities" unless the latter began assisting federal deportation policies</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/01/26/constitutional-problems-with-trumps-executive-order-on-sanctuary-cities/">executive order</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/07/27/jeff-sessions-attack-on-sanctuary-cities-is-also-an-assault-on-federalism-and-separation-of-powers/">Justice Department policies</a> targeting sanctuary jurisdictions, the new memorandum on "anarchist" jurisdictions doesn't actually order any denial of federal funds or impose any new conditions on grant recipients. Rather, it merely instructs the Director of the Office Management and Budget (OMB) to, within 14 days, "issue guidance to the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) for each agency to submit a report to the Director of OMB detailing all Federal funds provided to Seattle, Portland, New York City, Washington, D.C., or any components or instrumentalities of the foregoing jurisdictions." In addition, "[w]ithin 14 days of the date of this memorandum, and updated as appropriate but no less than every 6 months thereafter, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OMB, shall publish on the Department of Justice website a list identifying State and local jurisdictions that have permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures to counteract these criminal activities (anarchist jurisdictions)."</p>
<p>Among the policies used to identify supposed "anarchist jurisdictions" are factors such as "whether a jurisdiction disempowers or defunds police departments," whether it "unreasonably refuses to accept offers of law enforcement assistance from the Federal Government," and whether it bars "the police force from intervening to restore order amid widespread or sustained violence or destruction."</p>
<p>Significantly, however, the memorandum doesn't actually identify any particular federal grants that are to be cut or denied until such time as the jurisdiction in question ends law enforcement policies the White House disapproves of. The only actual mandate the memorandum imposes is a requirement that OMB and the Justice Department require a "review" of federal grants to several cities, and create a list of "anarchist" jurisdictions based on the vague criteria described above. It is far from clear what, if any, federal grants the administration would deny the offending "anarchists."</p>
<p>If the administration ultimately does identify specific federal grants that it wants to cut unless the targeted jurisdictions adopt law-enforcement policies that are more to the White House's liking, it could end up raising the same sorts of federalism and separation of powers issues as the administration's campaign against sanctuary cities. In that field, the administration has suffered <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3347171">a long series </a>of <a href="https://reason.com/2020/03/25/first-circuit-rules-against-trump-administration-in-sanctuary-cities-case/">defeats in court</a> because the conditions the administration sought to impose on federal grants either were never authorized by Congress (which controls the power of the purse), infringed on state and local autonomy under the Constitution, or both. The same thing could easily happen here if the administration once again tries to make up its own spending conditions in order to force states and localities to do its bidding. Trump has attempted to do the same thing on a variety of other issues, including <a href="https://reason.com/2020/05/20/trumps-threat-to-withhold-federal-funds-from-states-that-expand-voting-by-mail-highlights-growing-menace-to-federalism-and-separation-of-powers/">trying to use the threat of funding cutoffs</a> to prevent states from expanding vote-by-mail opportunities in the upcoming presidential election.</p>
<p>If the administration succeeds in these efforts, it would <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/381998-fight-over-sanctuary-cities-is-also-a-fight-over-federalism">set a dangerous precedent enabling the president to circumvent congressional control over federal spending, and bully states and localities into submission on a wide range of issues</a>, that go far beyond immigration, law enforcement, or voting. Conservatives who may cheer Trump's attacks on "anarchist jurisdictions" and sanctuary cities may not be so happy if Joe Biden or some other future Democratic president uses the same sweeping powers to force state and local government to adopt left-wing policies on gun control, education, environmental regulation, and much else.</p>
<p>Conservatives and others who value local and state autonomy should be wary of federal efforts to impose uniform policies on such quintessentially local issues as combating street crime. If even that must be brought under the control of the White House, it is not clear what, if anything, would be left to the states.</p>
<p>More generally, both right and left have reason to fear the kind of increasing concentration of power in the White House that would occur if the president had a free hand to control the federal budget and use it to pressure states and localities on a wide range of policies. That would both threaten valuable diversity in state and local policy, and undermine one of the best ways to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/01/03/how-federalism-can-help-save-the-failing-marriage-between-the-red-and-blue-states/">mitigate the dangerous political polarization between "red" and "blue" states</a>.</p>
<p>Condemning the administration's approach here does not require us to approve of all the law-enforcement policies adopted by liberal Democratic localities, some of which have indeed been overly tolerant of violence and rioting. As I have emphasized in the past, we should be able to take strong action to <a href="https://reason.com/2020/05/31/how-to-curb-police-abuses-and-how-not-to/">curtail police abuse</a> and <a href="https://reason.com/2020/06/08/the-problem-of-racial-profiling-why-it-matters-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/">racial profiling</a>, while simultaneously also <a href="https://reason.com/2020/05/31/how-to-curb-police-abuses-and-how-not-to/">rejecting rioting, looting, and private violence</a>. The latter are <a href="https://reason.com/2020/05/31/how-to-curb-police-abuses-and-how-not-to/">both intrinsically evil and likely to undermine the cause of ending racial discrimination and other unjust law enforcement practices</a>. I'm also <a href="https://reason.com/2020/06/11/rights-and-wrongs-of-defunding-the-police/">skeptical of indiscriminate "defunding" of police, even though there are beneficial ways to cut funding and limit police activity in a more targeted fashion</a>.</p>
<p>But the sins of some liberal local governments do not justify White House efforts to undermine federalism and separation of powers. Nor do they justify abuses by federal law enforcement agencies, such as <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/unpacking-dhss-troubling-explanation-portland-van-video">those we recently saw in Portland</a>. It would be better if the White House stuck to actual responsibilities of the federal government, and left local law enforcement alone, except in cases where the latter violates constitutional rights or properly enacted federal law.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apropos of Eugene's <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/03/usc-communications-professor-on-a-short-term-break-for-giving-chinese-word-neige-as-example/">post</a>, I have long wondered whether constitutional law casebook editors will need to expurgate a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14460863599772421355&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr#p640">passage</a> from Justice Jackson's famous <em>Youngstown</em> concurrence:</p>
<blockquote><p>I did not suppose, and I am not persuaded, that history leaves it open to question, at least in the courts, that the executive branch, like the Federal Government as a whole, possesses only delegated powers. The purpose of the Constitution was not only to grant power, but to keep it from getting out of hand. However, because the President does not enjoy unmentioned powers does not mean that the mentioned ones should be narrowed by a niggardly construction. Some clauses could be made almost unworkable, as well as immutable, by refusal to indulge some latitude of interpretation for changing times. I have heretofore, and do now, give to the enumerated powers the scope and elasticity afforded by what seem to be reasonable, practical implications instead of the rigidity dictated by a doctrinaire textualism.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[Those of you who dislike the Electoral College should find this idea of interest]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UC Berkeley professor Michael Eisen has been involved in a number of initially-crazy-sounding projects over the years, an alarming number of which (open access to scientific publication (<a href="https://plos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PLOS</a>), home genetic sequencing (<a href="http://23andme.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23andme</a>), plant-based "meat" (<a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impossible Foods</a>) have actually borne much fruit.  <a href="https://twitter.com/mbeisen/status/1301313837958799360?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is his latest&#8212;he himself calls it "disturbing and terrifying."<br />
Eisen's idea is a variation on the "National Popular Vote" (NPV) scheme.  For those of you unfamiliar with how NPV works, the basic idea is as follows (and many more details are available at the NPV website <a href="https://www.nationalpopularvote.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>):</p>
<p>A State&#8212;let's call it New York&#8212;enacts a statute with two basic provisions:</p>
<ol>
<li> The Governor shall appoint, as presidential electors, the slate of electors submitted by the presidential candidate who receives the largest number of votes cast <em>nationwide </em>in the presidential election. [Currently, of course, it is the candidate winning a plurality of votes cast <em>in NY</em> who gets all of NY's electors.]</li>
<li>Paragraph (1) shall only come into effect if and when a sufficient number of other States enact laws with the identical Paragraph (1) provision to cumulatively account for 270 (or more) electoral votes.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to admit, whatever your position might be on whether the Electoral College is or is not a useful institution, that it's a devilishly clever scheme. Without the need for a constitutional amendment, but relying instead on the power granted to the States in Article II to "appoint [electors] in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct," it would guarantee that the Electoral College would elect the winner of the nationwide popular vote, once the 270-electoral-vote threshold were met.</p>
<p>The NPV statute has been enacted into law in 16 jurisdictions, accounting cumulatively for 196 electoral votes (CA, CO, CT, DC, DE, HI, IL, MA, MD, NJ, NM, NY, OR, RI, VT, WA), leaving it 74 electoral votes short of the trigger. In nine additional states with 88 additional electoral votes (AR, AZ, ME, MI, MN, NC, NV, OK, VA) the NPV statute has passed in one house (but not the other) of the state legislature.</p>
<p>One obstacle which makes it difficult for the NPV to achieve the required level of support is the diminishing incentive for the "swing states"&#8212;the states that, in the current scheme, hold virtually all of the power in the presidential election (OH, PA, WI, FL, MI, VA, NC)&#8212;to join in the NPV scheme. The swing states are "swing" precisely because, unlike CA and AL and NY and KS and &hellip;, their electorates are pretty evenly divided between the two parties; because the NPV initiative is widely&#8212;though <a href="https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perhaps wrongly</a>&#8212;seen as favoring the "blue" team at the expense of the "reds," the political battle over the NPV, and the political opposition to joining with the NPV States, are likely to be particularly intense in these swing states.</p>
<p>Moreover, precisely because these are the States that effectively hold all the power in the current scheme, they might well be unwilling to give up that power by joining the NPV coalition. Votes, and voters, in the swing states matter <strong>a lot </strong>more, in the current presidential election environment, than the votes and voters in NY or AL or CA or KS.  The presidential candidates&#8212;both of them&#8212;will be paying an enormous amount of attention to the voters in swing states. The issues about which swing state voters are concerned will be front and center in the campaign&#8212;and the hundreds of millons, if not billions, of dollars that the candidates will be pouring into their states during the campaign, ain't bad, either.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, as the NPV gets closer and closer to the 270 trigger, the "swing states" who <strong>don't </strong>join in get even more power (and a bigger slice of those advertising dollars) than they have now.  Imagine if, say, PA (20 electoral votes), MI (16), and VA (13) had enacted the NPV statute.  The total would now stand at 196+49=245&#8212;a mere 25 votes short.  The voters in these states (PA, MI and VA) would now be just like voters in NY and AL; their votes would count (for purposes of the national popular vote), but they would no longer get any special additional weight from having come from a "swing state." On the other hand, the <strong>non-joining</strong> swing states&#8212;FL, OH, WI, NC&#8212;become even swing-ier than before, with even more attention being paid to corralling their contested electoral votes than before.</p>
<p>If you are a supporter of the NPV, this is not a great position to be in; as the network of joining states gets larger, those states that have not yet joined are under <strong>more</strong> of a disincentive to join. It's a kind of negative feedback, and negative feedback's not the best way to grow a network.</p>
<p>Enter Mike Eisen.  Here's what he's proposing as a substitute for the current NPV statute:</p>
<ol>
<li> The Governor shall appoint, as presidential electors, the slate of electors submitted by the presidential candidate who receives the largest number of votes cast, in the aggregate pool of voters in those states (the "Joining States") that have enacted a paragraph identical to this one.</li>
<li> Paragraph (1) shall only come into effect when the cumulative electoral votes in the Joining States equals or exceeds 270.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how this works.  The States enacting this revised NPV law would be agreeing (once the 270 trigger is achieved) to pool their votes with all the other States that have signed onto this scheme, and to give all of their electoral votes to the candidate who receives a plurality of the <strong>pooled</strong> <strong>votes </strong>from those Joining States.</p>
<p>And notice that if this statute ever <strong>were </strong>to come into effect because the 270-vote threshold was met<strong>, it would render the votes in the non-joining states completely worthless; votes from non-joining States would play no part whatsoever in determining whom the Electoral College would select as the next president.</strong></p>
<p>That is, if we were to reach the 270-Electoral-vote trigger point, the Joining States would pool their votes together in a pile, determine the candidate who received the most votes in the entire pool, and then they would <strong>all designate their Electors to vote for that candidate</strong>.  And, under the premise that we had reached the 270-vote trigger, that would be sufficient to elect that candidate president no matter what happened in the other non-Joining States.</p>
<p>I think you can see why Prof. Eisen called this "disturbing."  Votes in non-Joining states no longer count at all in determining who gets to be president. Under this scheme, <strong>if Ohio does not Join and agree to pool its vote with other Joiners, it runs the risk that enough other States will Join to make Ohio voters completely irrelevant in the presidential election.  </strong></p>
<p>And <strong>that</strong> risk&#8212;the risk that the voters in your State will be rendered a total irrelevance the moment the 270 threshold is met&#8212;<strong>intensifies</strong> as the Joiners get closer and closer to 270.</p>
<p>Voila! Positive feedback; the more States that Join, the greater the incentive for non-Joiners to Join, which adds more States to the pool, which increases further the incentive for non-Joiners to Join, and so on.</p>
<p>Could this actually work?  Is it really constitutional?</p>
<p>I think the answer to both questions, surprisingly, is "yes."  Neither is simple, so I'll save my more detailed thoughts for subsequent postings, and just make these observations:</p>
<p>Whether it would work depends a bit on what it means to "work."  If your goal is to create a system under which the winner of the popular vote gets to be president, I think this will do it for you.  Notice that under this scheme any non-Joining State can, at any time, enter the ranks of the Joined States. So suppose that Ohio refuses to Join.  If the statutory trigger is activated, it faces a simple choice: Watch the next presidential election from the sidelines, with your voters playing no role in determining the outcome, or Join so that Ohioans' votes count for something. And the same choice would be facing Nebraska, and Alaska, and any other non-Joiners.  Indeed, I think this little statute has an almost unstoppable dynamic behind it, and that it would&#8212;possibly quite quickly&#8212;become law in <strong>all</strong> states; what State would <strong>not </strong>want its voters to have any say at all in who becomes the next president?</p>
<p>And there you'd have it; the "pool" would then consist of the entire country, each State's electors would be pledged to the candidate winning the <strong>nationwide</strong> pooled popular vote, and that candidate would be elected&#8212;unanimously&#8212;by the Electoral College. So if that's your goal, this will, I think, get you there.</p>
<p>As for the constitutional question(s), the Supreme Court just this past term (in the "faithless elector" cases, <em>Chiafalo v. Washington</em> and <em>Colorado v. Baca</em>) strongly, and unanimously, re-affirmed the broad, plenary authority given to the States in Article 2 to appoint electors in any manner they see fit. As I read these and other precedents on this matter, NY is perfectly free to declare, in its election law, that it will appoint electors in accordance with the popular vote count in New Jersey; it would be odd if it did so, but it would not be unconstitutional.  And if NY can do that, why can't it say that it will appoint electors in accordance with the popular vote count in NY+NJ+any other State that wants to be in the common pool.</p>
<p>State power in this regard is, presumably, subject to the other binding provisions of the federal constitution; NY cannot declare that it will only appoint white males as electors, for example.  But I'm having trouble seeing how Eisen's proposal runs afoul of any superseding constitutional provision.  I suppose that an Ohioan could assert that the scheme violates the principle of "one person/one vote" under the Equal Protection Clause, by causing his/her vote to count for nothing in NY's determination of who to appoint as an elector while a New Jerseyan gets a say in the matter. But does an Ohioan have standing to challenge NY election law? And in any event, it's hard to see how an Ohioan somehow has a constitutional right to have his/her votes counted by NY; it's not as though under the current, and presumably constitutional, scheme NY takes Ohioans' preferences into account when choosing its electors&#8212;so how can an Ohioan contend that this "right" was violated by the NPV scheme?</p>

        <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit yesterday <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/09/02/13-50572.pdf">ruled</a> that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephone records was illegal and probably unconstitutional. For Democrats who see Donald Trump as an unprecedented threat because of his disregard for the Constitution, the decision is a useful reminder that sacrificing civil liberties on the altar of national security is a bipartisan rite.</p>
<p>The NSA program, which was <a href="https://reason.com/2013/06/05/obamas-nsa-is-collecting-phone-records-o/">revealed</a> by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, indiscriminately collected telephone "metadata"—indicating who was calling whom and how long they talked—about millions of Americans for years. The program, which the USA FREEDOM Act <a href="https://reason.com/2015/11/29/the-nsa-will-stop-collecting-your-phone/">ended</a> in 2015, began under George W. Bush but continued during Barack Obama's administration, which concealed its existence, then speciously defended its legality and usefulness.</p>
<p>"The administration has now lost all credibility," <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://reason.com/2013/06/06/the-new-yorks-times-on-obama-and-the-nsa/">editorialized</a> after Snowden's revelations. "Mr. Obama is proving the truism that the executive will use any power it is given and very likely abuse it."</p>
<p>James Clapper, the Air Force general whom Obama appointed as director of national intelligence, epitomized the administration's dishonesty by <a href="https://reason.com/2013/06/07/heres-national-intelligence-director-cla/">blatantly lying</a> to a Senate committee about the NSA's data collection practices three months before the phone record database was revealed, then repeatedly <a href="https://reason.com/2013/12/20/clapper-wont-stop-lying-about-his-lie-ma/">lying about lying</a>. In his latest incarnation, Clapper is a vociferous Trump critic who <a href="https://reason.com/2018/05/25/james-clapper-thinks-americans-are-dumb/">blames Russia</a> for the election of a president he <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-a-former-us-spy-chief-became-trumps-fiercest-critic/">despises</a> as a man "whose first instincts are to twist and distort truth to his advantage."</p>
<p>Further scrambling the conventional understanding of which major party is more concerned about civil liberties, Obama tried to prosecute Snowden, while Trump, who in 2013 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/16/trump-once-demanded-edward-snowdens-execution-for-giving-serious-information-to-russia/">called</a> Snowden "a traitor" who "should be executed," last month <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/14/trump-teases-possible-edward-snowden-pardon-he-should-do-it/">suggested</a> he might pardon the NSA whistleblower. Another interesting point Democrats might prefer to overlook: While questioning the constitutionality of the NSA's metadata dragnet, the 9th Circuit cites Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump nominee who is a <a href="https://reason.com/2019/11/16/but-gorsuch/">more reliable defender</a> of the Fourth Amendment than the <a href="https://reason.com/2016/03/23/the-perils-of-merrick-garlands-moderatio/">judge</a> Obama wanted to appoint.</p>
<p>I am not for a moment suggesting that Trump's new respect for Snowden, which is probably driven by his pique at "deep state" foes like Clapper, or his choice of Gorsuch, which was based on what he thought conservatives wanted, reflects civil libertarian principles (or any principles at all). But as this case shows, Trump's polarizing personality tends to obscure the deeper problem of powers that tempt presidents to violate our rights, regardless of their personal traits, avowed principles, or party affiliation.</p>
<p>The prosecution that led to the 2nd Circuit's decision involved four Somali immigrants who were convicted in 2013 of sending money to the terrorist group al-Shabab. While the ruling does not affect those convictions, it addresses the legality of the NSA's phone record database, which supposedly played a crucial role in the case.</p>
<p>I say "supposedly" because that is what federal officials claimed while defending the NSA's program. Then-FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce, for example, told a congressional committee the database generated a tip that allowed the bureau to reopen its investigation of the suspected al-Shabab supporters. The 2nd Circuit rightly discounts such statements, which were part of a <a href="https://reason.com/2015/03/30/you-know-who-else-thought-the-nsa-mass-m/">fact-deficient</a> attempt to portray the program as an essential weapon against terrorism.</p>
<p>"The metadata collection, even if unconstitutional, did not taint the evidence introduced by the government at trial," the appeals court <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/09/02/13-50572.pdf">says</a>. "To the extent the public statements of government officials created a contrary impression, that impression is inconsistent with the contents of the classified record." That's a polite way of saying that Obama administration officials misled the public about the program's value.</p>
<p>What about its legality? As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit <a href="https://reason.com/2015/05/07/federal-court-rules-mass-metadata-collec/">did in 2015</a>, the 9th Circuit makes short work of the government's argument that the program was authorized by Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, which allowed secret court orders "requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation&hellip;to protect against international terrorism." Such orders were supposed to be based on "a statement of facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation."</p>
<p>Using the same <a href="https://reason.com/2015/06/03/needles-haystacks-and-nsa-snooping/">needle-in-a-haystack argument</a> that was deployed by the Obama administration, the government's lawyers maintained that everyone's phone records are "relevant to an authorized investigation" because searching them might reveal useful clues. "Although admittedly a substantial portion of the telephony metadata that is collected would not relate to [terrorism suspects]," they said, "the intelligence tool that the Government hopes to use to find [investigation-related] communications—metadata analysis—requires collecting and storing large volumes of the metadata to enable later analysis." According to the government, "all of the metadata collected is thus relevant, because the success of this investigative tool depends on bulk collection."</p>
<p>The 2nd Circuit <a href="https://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/7c126578-16e1-4618-9f62-e889e27ce49d/20/doc/14-42_complete_opn.pdf">said</a> "such an expansive concept of 'relevance' is unprecedented and unwarranted," and the 9th Circuit concurs. The government's interpretation "essentially reads the 'authorized investigation' language out of the statute," it says. "We hold that the telephony metadata collection program exceeded the scope of Congress's authorization."</p>
<p>As for the program's constitutionality, the government argued that it was covered by the <a href="https://reason.com/2017/11/29/your-secrets-are-not-safe-with-anyone/">third-party doctrine</a>, which says people do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding information they voluntarily divulge to others (in this case, the phone companies from which the NSA collected its metadata). The Supreme Court invented that doctrine in <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/425/435.html"><em>United States v. Miller</em></a>, a 1976 case involving bank records. Three years later, the Court invoked the doctrine in <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/442/735.html"><em>Smith v. Maryland</em></a>, which involved a warrantless "pen register" that police used to record the numbers dialed by a robbery suspect over the course of a few days. Although that situation is rather different from the collection of personal information about millions of people for years, the government argued that <em>Smith</em> shows the NSA's program was consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p>"There are strong reasons to doubt that <em>Smith</em> applies here," the 9th Circuit says. "The distinctions between <em>Smith</em> and this case are legion and most probably constitutionally significant&hellip;.Society may not have recognized as reasonable Smith's expectation of privacy in a few days' worth of dialed numbers but is much more likely to perceive as private several years' worth of telephony metadata collected on an ongoing, daily basis—as demonstrated by the public outcry following the revelation of the metadata collection program."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>drew a distinction between the "contents" of a phone call and information about numbers dialed, deeming the latter much less sensitive. But "in recent years the distinction between content and metadata 'has become increasingly untenable,'" the appeals court notes. "The amount of metadata created and collected has increased exponentially, along with the government's ability to analyze it."</p>
<p>The 9th Circuit emphasizes how revealing this information can be, quoting former NSA General Counsel Stewart Baker. "Metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody's life," Baker said. "If you have enough metadata you don't really need content."</p>
<p>The appeals court illustrates that point with a couple of examples: "A woman calls her sister at 2:00 a.m. and talks for an hour. The record of that call reveals some of the woman's personal information, but more is revealed by access to the sister's call records, which show that the sister called the woman's husband immediately afterward. Or, a police officer calls his college roommate for the first time in years. Afterward, the roommate calls a suicide hotline."</p>
<p>And that's just for a start. "Metadata can be combined and analyzed to reveal far more sophisticated information than one or two individuals' phone records convey," the 9th Circuit notes before quoting a brief filed by the Brennan Center for Justice: "It is relatively simple to superimpose our metadata trails onto the trails of everyone within our social group and those of everyone within our contacts' social groups and quickly paint a picture that can be startlingly detailed."</p>
<p>The 9th Circuit notes that the Supreme Court expressed similar concerns in <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/16-402.html"><em>Carpenter v. United States</em></a>, the 2018 case in which the justices <a href="https://reason.com/2018/06/22/scotus-rejects-warrantless-tracking-of-c/">said</a> the third-party doctrine does not apply to cellphone location data. Furthermore, the appeals court says, "numerous commentators and two Supreme Court Justices have questioned the continuing viability of the third-party doctrine under current societal realities."</p>
<p>Here is where Gorsuch comes in. He <a href="https://reason.com/2018/06/22/neil-gorsuch-joins-sonia-sotomayor-in-qu/">dissented</a> in <em>Carpenter</em>, not because he thought cops should be allowed to collect cellphone location data without a warrant but because he thought the third-party doctrine should be scrapped entirely, along with the malleable "reasonable expectation" test. Nowadays, Gorsuch noted, people routinely store sensitive information—including "private documents" that, "in other eras, we would have locked safely in a desk drawer or destroyed"—on third-party servers. According to the reasoning of <em>Miller</em> and <em>Smith</em>, he said, "police can review all of this material, on the theory that no one reasonably expects any of it will be kept private. But no one believes that, if they ever did."</p>
<p>The 9th Circuit did not reach a firm conclusion about the constitutionality of the NSA's program, because it was not necessary to decide whether the convictions should stand. But its observations show how readily the government invades our privacy on the flimsiest pretext, blithely dismissing constitutional concerns when they prove inconvenient. That alarming tendency cannot be corrected by switching out one politician for another.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=15580">Campus Reform</a> has the story on Prof. Greg Patton, who is "no longer teaching his" Fall semester course:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Recently, a USC faculty member during class used a Chinese word that sounds similar to a racial slur in English. We acknowledge the historical, cultural and harmful impact of racist language," the statement read.</p>
<p>Patton "agreed to take a short term pause while we are reviewing to better understand the situation and to take any appropriate next steps."</p></blockquote>
<p>It includes this video; the USC business school confirmed to me that the video was authentic and the Campus Reform story was accurate:</p>
<p><iframe title="DO YOU THINK THIS PROFESSOR SHOULD BE FIRED?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4M0aD78sw8U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Prof. Patton, in addition to generally being a <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/greg-patton">professor of business communication</a>, is also with the <a href="https://china.usc.edu/profile/patton-gregory-h">USC US-China Institute</a> (which might help explain why he would give examples from Chinese):</p>
<blockquote><p>His international work has primarily focused on China and the Pacific Rim.  He is a key advisor to the Center for Asian-Pacific Leadership at USC, a member of USC's US-China Institute and teaches several courses at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai in the Marshall School's Global Executive MBA Program.</p>
<p>Dr. Patton leads MBA learning programs in Korea and China and has advised on several hundred consulting engagements throughout the Pacific Rim in more than a dozen countries.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=48302">Prof. Victor Mair (Language Log), a linguist and Sinologist</a>, passes along this statement from the USC Marshall School of Business dean about the controversy:</p>
<p><span id="more-8083039"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Full-Time MBA Class of 2021,</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and involvement in the current situation concerning the Class of 2022 and their GSBA-542 experience. This matter is of great importance to all of us. Accordingly, I want to make you aware of the action we are taking. This action is described in the attached email* that was just sent to all students in the Class of 2022.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Geoff Garrett<br />
Dean</p>
<p>[*see next item below]</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>Last Thursday in your GSBA-542 classes, Professor Greg Patton repeated several times a Chinese word that sounds very similar to a vile racial slur in English. Understandably, this caused great pain and upset among students, and for that I am deeply sorry. It is simply unacceptable for faculty to use words in class that can marginalize, hurt and harm the psychological safety of our students. We must and we will do better.</p>
<p>Professor Marion Philadelphia, Chair of the Department of Business Communications, will take over teaching the remainder of GSBA-542, beginning tomorrow, Tuesday August 25.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks and months, I have no higher priority than to work with Vice Dean Sharoni Little, Vice Dean Suh-Pyng Ku and the other members of the Marshall leadership team to identify and redress bias, microaggressions, inequities and all forms of systemic racism associated with anyone's identity throughout our school. We each must grow and learn always to engage respectfully with one another while fostering and exemplifying the knowledge and skills needed to lead and shape our diverse and global world—such as courage, empathy, compassion, advocacy, collaboration, and integrity.</p>
<p>I am deeply saddened by this disturbing episode that has caused such anguish and trauma. What happened cannot be undone. But please know that Sharoni, Suh-Pyng and I along with the entire Full-Time MBA Program team are here to support each of you. We welcome the opportunity to have conversations with any of you individually.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Geoff Garrett<br />
Dean</p></blockquote>
<p>If twenty years ago Rush Limbaugh had given this incident as a hypothetical on his show (perhaps following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_word_niggardly#David_Howard_incident">"niggardly" controversy</a>), I expected he would have been derided as creating an obviously ridiculous straw-man caricature of liberal universities, a silly and unrealistic slippery slope argument. And yet here we are.</p>
<p>Two other letters to close this post. First, the letter that I think Dean Garrett should have written:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>Last Thursday in your GSBA-542 classes, Professor Greg Patton repeated several times a Chinese word (generally transliterated in English as "neige") that sounds very similar to a vile racial slur in English.</p>
<p>This should go without saying, but of course many languages have words that sound vaguely like English epithets or vulgarities, and vice versa. Naturally, USC students are expected to understand this, and recognize that such accidents of pronunciation have nothing to do with any actually insulting or offensive meaning.</p>
<p>To the extent that our first reaction to hearing such a word might be shock or upset, part of language education (or education of any sort) is to learn to set that aside. The world's nearly one billion Mandarin speakers have no obligation to organize their speech to avoid random similarities with English words, and neither do our faculty (or students or anyone else) when they are speaking Mandarin. Indeed, it would be oddly Anglocentric (and indeed offensive to Mandarin speakers) to assume otherwise. And it is simply unacceptable for a university to try to impose any such obligation.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks and months, one of my high priorities is to make sure that we teach students this and similar basic matters, because otherwise we would be failing in our educational mission. Students who seek to help lead and shape our diverse and global world have to learn to go beyond their initial reactions, and beyond their impulses to try to suppress things simply because they sound vaguely offensive—especially when those impulses stem simply from an (understandably) parochial view that comes from lack of real knowledge of foreign languages and cultures. We each must grow and learn always to engage respectfully with one another.</p>
<p>I am deeply saddened that some students were disturbed by the episode, because such disturbance reflects a failure of our educational system. I resolve that we at USC will teach our students the principles and tools that will keep them from falling into this sort of reaction. Please know that Prof. Patton and I along with the entire Full-Time MBA Program team are here to support each of you, by educating you on these principles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, an e-mail that Prof. Mair reproduces in his post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Patton,</p>
<p>I am a student from your communication class in last year's term 1. I received an email from the dean regarding your removal from teaching communication class because of your use of the word <a href="https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=%E9%82%A3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define%3D%25E9%2582%25A3&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598739217789000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0fnO6nEv9_xFfGkOTeulD7U6OmA"><b>那</b></a><a href="https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define=%E4%B8%AA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php?define%3D%25E4%25B8%25AA&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598739217789000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9xQQ7Eaw-3ueEp9KU0UQ4s0Z3aA"><b>个</b></a> (nà ge) in Chinese as part of a communication example. I am disgusted with the administration's response and their lack of support of a colleague that did nothing wrong. If students seek to mis-interpret the word as a racial slur and claim their "mental health has been affected," so be it.  Please know that there are many people that support you and are sick of this hyper-sensitive, McCarthyism-like environment that is being fostered across the country."</p></blockquote>

        <p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said on a <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BRJjYrdbqaGw">press call today</a> that he would not allow indoor dining to return in New York City unless local politicians devoted significant police resources to enforcing social distancing and other reopening conditions.</p>
<p>"Our rules and guidance on reopening is only as good as the compliance and the enforcement," Cuomo said, adding that state resources have already been stretched thin attempting to enforce limits on the serving of alcohol by outdoor restaurants in the city. "If we open restaurants that's going to complicate by the hundreds if not thousands the number of establishments that have to be monitored."</p>
<p>Restaurants are allowed to open for outdoor dining in New York City, but can only serve alcohol to seated patrons who've also ordered a meal, per a <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-regulations-bars-and-restaurants-ensure-compliance-state-social">July executive order</a> from Cuomo.</p>
<p>The governor's latest comments come a day after New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/press/2020/09/02/2014/">issued a statement</a> endorsing the reopening of indoor dining areas.</p>
<p>"It's time to allow indoor dining in New York City with reduced capacity and clear guidance to ensure social distancing and safety," Johnson said yesterday. "Summer is winding down, and they need to begin planning for the colder months."</p>
<p>Restaurants in the rest of New York state have been allowed to reopen their dining rooms at <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/Food_Services_Summary_Guidelines.pdf">50 percent capacity</a> provided they maintain six feet of distance between parties and following other physical distancing guidelines. Earlier this week, one New York City restaurant <a href="https://gothamist.com/food/queens-restaurant-leads-2-billion-indoor-dining-lawsuit-against-ny">filed</a> a $2 billion class-action lawsuit against state and local officials over their continued ban on indoor dining.</p>
<p>"We're going to contact the Speaker today and say if New York City can say this many police, NYPD, can be put on a task force to monitor the compliance, that is something we can discuss," Cuomo said during his press call today, suggesting that 4,000 officers would be needed to police indoor dining establishments.</p>
<p>"The Speaker is talking to the Governor about how we can help bring indoor dining to the five boroughs," a council spokesperson told <em>Reason</em>. Johnson agrees with the need for compliance but wants other city agencies—not NYPD—to be involved with enforcement.</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said today at a press conference that he was looking into extending the city's Open Restaurants initiative—which allows businesses to set up on sidewalks, curb lanes, and streets—beyond its current October 31 expiration date, <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/we-need-to-decide-timeline-for-nyc-indoor-dining-this-month-mayor-says-with-a-caveat/2599749/">reports</a> <em>NBC New York</em>.</p>
<p>The mayor remained non-committal about when indoor dining might return, saying, "It has to be health and safety first. It has to be, how do we defeat coronavirus? That's the first consideration." De Blasio previously said that he would make a decision this month on when restaurants could reopen their dining rooms. Cuomo has stressed that allowing indoor dining is his decision <a href="https://gothamist.com/food/nyc-restaurant-industry-implores-city-state-immediate-plan-resuming-indoor-dining">to make</a>.</p>
<p>New York City's Hospitality Alliance, which represents restaurants, has been demanding the return of indoor dining for weeks now.</p>
<p>"The city exceeds and sustains the metrics that have allowed restaurants throughout the rest of the State to reopen," <a href="https://thenycalliance.org/information/nyc-indoor-dining-we-demand-a-plan">said</a> Hospitality Alliance executive direction Andrew Rigie in an August press conference. "Our industry's survival over the next several months depends on government immediately developing and implementing a plan that allows restaurants in New York City to safely reopen indoors."</p>

        <p>It doesn't sound like Spencer Cox is planning a victory party for November 3.</p>
<p>"I told my people, 'We are not going to know who won this on election night,'" Cox, Utah's Republican gubernatorial nominee, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/08/utah-republicans-who-love-vote-mail/615739/">told</a> <em>The Atlantic</em>'s McCay Coppins.</p>
<p>Think about that for a second. Utah hasn't elected a Democrat to be governor since 1984, and it has been voted Republican in <a href="https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/">every presidential election since 1964</a>. If Cox thinks he might be waiting a long time for his race to be called this year, just imagine what that means for anyone waiting for the results of a more competitive election in a state with a lot more voters.</p>
<p>In Utah, those long waits have become the norm. It's one of only a handful of states to rely primarily on mail-in voting—and while the system is safe and effective, it does take a bit longer to tally the results. When Cox won the state's Republican gubernatorial primary earlier this year, for example, it took until the Monday after Election Day for the race to be called.</p>
<p>"That's very common," he says. "It's just a paradigm shift that people have had to get used to."</p>
<p>The rest of the country doesn't have much time to get up to speed.</p>
<p>Thanks to both historical trends and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/06/america-is-going-to-vote-by-mail-were-not-ready/">more people are going to vote by mail</a> this year than ever before. Political campaigns and media coverage have focused on how <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/14/dont-blame-donald-trump-if-the-post-office-loses-your-vote/">increased mail-in balloting</a> will affect the run-up to Election Day, but the real challenge may come after November 3 has passed. Mailed ballots take longer to process than those cast in person—to prevent fraud, each ballot must be individually checked and recorded by election officials. Even with computers, that's a time-consuming process. A large number of ballots will certainly remain uncounted when Election Day comes to a close.</p>
<p>"The problem is logistical," says Yuval Levin, director of social, cultural, and constitutional studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. He notes that some states took weeks to finish counting absentee and mailed-in ballots during this year's primary season. "We should expect that we won't have results on election night and that it will take some time. That doesn't mean that the results are not legitimate."</p>
<p>Instead of being a single, distinct event, Election Day 2020 will unspool from November 3 in <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/02/time-may-not-exist-anymore-but-tenet-does-and-its-in-theaters-now/">both directions along our timeline</a> at varying rates of speed. There will be a slow build-up as ballots will be mailed, filled out, and returned. That's followed by the day itself, when many people will go to the polls more-or-less as usual, with those results reported that night. Then comes the crucial (and potentially agonizing) process of counting perhaps millions of mailed-in ballots. If nothing else, it will be appropriate for a year when time seems to have little meaning.</p>
<p>When it comes to the presidential race, there's one very important post-election deadline that the states must meet: the planned December 14 gathering of the Electoral College. Six days before that date, each state must certify a winner in the presidential race so the appropriate electors can do the official business of choosing the next president.</p>
<p>That deadline played a key role in concluding the most controversial election in recent American history. The infamous recount of Florida's votes in the 2000 presidential election was brought to a halt, in part, because the state ran up against a federal law that requires presidential electors <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/on-this-day-bush-v-gore-anniversary">to be determined six days before the Electoral College meets</a>.</p>
<p>This year, if multiple states are still counting absentee ballots into the first week of December and the election's winner is still unknown, things could get messy.</p>
<p>"If there are these logistical problems, states could just run out of time," says Levin.</p>
<p>His preferred solution: Postpone the Electoral College's meeting until the first week in January. The Electoral College itself is a constitutional requirement, but the day it meets to determine the election's winner is set by federal law. A simple vote in Congress and a presidential signature could give states more time to finish counting votes.</p>
<p>Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) has already introduced a bill to do just that. His legislation would give states until the end of the year to finish counting and to certify electors, with the Electoral College meeting on January 2 instead of December 14.</p>
<p>"We cannot escape the pandemic-induced reality of increased mail-in voting, and the logistical challenges associated with it will be difficult for some states to resolve in the next couple of months," Rubio wrote in a Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@SenatorMarcoRubio/americans-should-expect-election-chaos-7fa8a9ac5aa1">post</a> announcing his bill. He envisions a scenario in which one candidate leads in a key swing state by fewer than 100,000 votes on Election Day but the state has more than a million mail-in ballots yet to be counted. That's a distinct possibility, particularly in the 15 states where officials aren't allowed to start counting ballots until Election Day even if they arrive earlier.</p>
<p>"We should give states the flexibility to provide local election officials additional time to count each and every vote," says Rubio.</p>
<p>"I think just by giving the states more time we could avoid one kind of disaster we might encounter," Levin says, though he acknowledges that the time for Congress to act is quickly running out. As Election Day nears, any changes to the process will likely be seen as a political calculation intended to help or hurt one party or the other.</p>
<p>It maybe already be too late. President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-people-vote-twice.html">seems intent</a> on spurring as much chaos as possible during the election season, and it seems unlikely that the White House would agree to give states more time to count absentee ballots when the president is also insisting that increased levels of voting by mail will hurt his chances at re-election. His campaign has also <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/13/the-election-could-be-chaotic-why-is-trumps-campaign-trying-to-make-it-worse/">sued states for expanding mail-in voting</a>.</p>
<p>In reality, there's no reason to suspect that <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/06/america-is-going-to-vote-by-mail-were-not-ready/">higher levels of voting by mail</a> will advantage Democrats. Republicans like Rubio are trying to do the right thing by giving states more time to count votes, and Republicans like Cox are right to warn voters that election results will take more time than usual to process.</p>
<p>Americans are living through an election season unlike any other. At least the stakes aren't too high.</p>

                />            </div>
        <p>Greg Patton is a professor of clinical business communication at the University of Southern California. During a recent virtual classroom session, he was discussing public speaking patterns and the filler words that people use to space out their ideas: <em>um</em>, <em>er</em>, etc. Patton mentioned that the Chinese often use a word that is pronounced like <em>nega.</em></p>
<p>"In China the common word is 'that, that that that,' so in China it might be '<em>nega, nega, nega, nega,'" </em>Patton explained to his class. "So there's different words you'll hear in different cultures, but they're vocal disfluencies."</p>
<p>But because the Chinese word <em>nega </em>sounds like <em>nigger, </em>some students were offended and reported the matter to the administration. Patton is now suspended, according to <em><a href="https://campusreform.org/?ID=15580">Campus</a></em><a href="https://campusreform.org/?ID=15580"><em> Reform</em></a><em>:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>On Tuesday evening, the USC Marshall School of Business provided <em>Campus Reform</em> with a statement, confirming that Patton is no longer teaching his course.</p>
<p>"Recently, a USC faculty member during class used a Chinese word that sounds similar to a racial slur in English. We acknowledge the historical, cultural and harmful impact of racist language," the statement read.</p>
<p>Patton "agreed to take a short term pause while we are reviewing to better understand the situation and to take any appropriate next steps."</p>
<p>Another instructor is temporarily teaching the class.</p>
<p>USC is now "offering supportive measures to any student, faculty, or staff member who requests assistance." The school is "committed to building a culture of respect and dignity where all members of our community can feel safe, supported, and can thrive."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is ridiculous. It seems clear that Patton did not mean to harm anyone, and that the point he was making was perfectly valid. The resemblance between these two words is purely coincidental, and adults should be perfectly capable of hearing the Chinese version without fainting in front of their computer screens. Anyone who is <em>this </em>prepared to be bothered all the time needs to turn down their outrage dial.</p>
<p>"I'll say this ten thousand times, but if anyone thinks they're helping the cause of racial equality by engaging in absurd, over-the-top speech policing of innocent people, then they're sadly mistaken," <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidAFrench/status/1301562394896982017">wrote</a> <em>The Dispatch</em>'s David French.</p>
<p>There is nothing for the university to investigate: Patton should be restored to his teaching position immediately. If anything, the offended students should apologize to <em>him </em>for causing the inconvenience.</p>

        <p>Two months before the death of George Floyd launched a summer of protests, riots, and demands for police reform, officers in Rochester, New York, handcuffed Daniel T. Prude in the middle of the street, put a bag over his head, and pinned the naked man onto the street while he panicked. This continued until Prude stopped breathing. He ultimately died.</p>
<p>The general public is finding out about the incident this week because Prude's family and local activists <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/09/02/daniel-prude-rochester-ny-police-died-march-2020-after-officers-restrained-him/5682948002/">released police body-camera video</a> of the incident on Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to reporting from the Rochester <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/09/02/daniel-prude-rochester-ny-police-died-march-2020-after-officers-restrained-him/5682948002/"><em>Democrat and Chronicle</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/nyregion/daniel-prude-rochester-police.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, police responded to a 911 call on March 23 from Prude's brother. Prude, who had recently been taken to the hospital for mental health issues, had run out of his home and was behaving erratically.</p>
<p>When Rochester police responded to the call, they found him running in the street. Somebody else had in the meantime called 911 to say that a naked man had tried to break into a car. Police believe he also broke windows at a nearby business. According to the <em>Democrat and Chronicle</em>, Prude encountered several other people during his journey and even begged one to call 911 for him.</p>
<p>The body camera footage shows Prude clearly in a state of distress when the officers confront him. They order Prude to the ground with his hands behind his back, and he complies immediately. He never tries to get physical with them, but his behavior remains erratic: He yells at the officers, he starts spitting, and he claims to have the coronavirus. The officers then put him in what they call a "spit hood." (The <em>Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/nyregion/daniel-prude-rochester-police.html">notes</a> that these hoods have been involved in 70 deaths in the past decade and have been cited in police lawsuits.)</p>
<p>Prude yells "Gimme that gun!" at the officers and demands one officer's Taser. Eventually they press Prude to the ground, pushing his head into the pavement. The time stamps on the video show he was held down for about 3 minutes. An emergency medical technician arrives, but the officers don't mention that Prude isn't moving. Three minutes later, the EMT asks the officers to roll Prude over, and that's when they realize that he's no longer breathing.</p>
<p>After that, Prude was given CPR and loaded into an ambulance. He was actually revived for a time, but he was declared brain dead due to the lack of oxygen. On March 30, he was removed from life support and died.</p>
<p>Here's an edited version of the video from the <em>Democrat and Chronicle</em>:</p>
<p><iframe title="DEMOCRATANDCHRONICLE-Embed Player" src="https://uw-media.democratandchronicle.com/embed/video/5691296002?placement=snow-embed" width="540" height="350" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A subsequent toxicology report showed low levels of PCP in Prude's bloodstream, which could have explained some of his behavior. The autopsy report attributed Prude's death to "complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint due to excited delirium due to acute [PCP] intoxication."</p>
<p>"<a href="https://reason.com/2016/08/17/zombie-drug-paranoia-resurfaces/">Excited delirium</a>" is a controversial diagnosis that is not actually recognized by the American Medical Association or the American Psychiatric Association; it seems to occur primarily—perhaps even exclusively—during encounters with law enforcement. (Read more <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/chokehold-police-excited-delirium/2020/07/17/fe907ec8-c6bc-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html">here</a> on the sordid history of the term and its use to justify violent interactions with people in a drug-induced or mental health crisis.)</p>
<p>In the video, one EMT and an officer on the scene affirm to each other that Prude was under the influence of "excited delirium." The EMT assures the officer, "It's not you guys's fault."</p>
<p>None of the officers involved have been disciplined, but the New York attorney general's office is investigating the death. More than 100 protesters gathered Wednesday afternoon in Rochester, and nine were arrested and cited with misdemeanor charges in clashes with police.</p>
<p>Prude's case is a prime example of what policing reform activists mean when they call for hanging the role of policing so that people with guns and Tasers are not the first responders to somebody having a mental health or drug crisis.</p>

        <p>The Trump administration's new <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/02/the-cdcs-eviction-moratorium-threatens-landlords-with-100000-fines-a-year-in-jail-for-noncompliance/">nationwide moratorium on evictions</a> is attracting heated opposition from some Republicans in Congress, who say it is legally shaky and sets a dangerous precedent for future administrations.</p>
<p>"I think the legal authority is a real stretch," says Sen. Pat Toomey (R–Penn.). "I don't know what the limiting principle is."</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which issued the moratorium on Tuesday, cites its authority under the Public Health Services Act to issue regulations to stop the interstate spread of disease. That argument doesn't impress Toomey.</p>
<p>"If the CDC has the authority to force landlords to effectively give away their product for free, I don't know where that ends," Toomey tells <em>Reason</em>. "Can General Motors be forced to give people cars unless they otherwise crowd into subways?"</p>
<p>Other congressional Republicans have raised similar concerns. Sen. Rand Paul (R–Ky.) <a href="https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1301522967982112770">said</a> on Twitter that the "CDC does not have the authority to do this. It's dangerous precedent and bad policy."</p>
<p>"Rental contracts are governed by state law. There is no federal authority to overturn them," <a href="https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1301335629754703872">tweeted</a> Rep. Thomas Massie (R–Ky.). "The CDC order is an affront to the rule of law, and an emasculation of every legislator in this country—state and federal."</p>
<p>In addition to the legal issues it raises, Toomey argues that the CDC's eviction moratorium is bad policy.</p>
<p>"There's not some mass wave of evictions going on," he argues. "It is in the interest of landlords to work out agreements with tenants going through difficult circumstances." A moratorium on evictions, he suggests, would encourage non-payment of rent and disincentivize deals between tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>According to data from Princeton University's <a href="https://evictionlab.org/map/#/2016?geography=states&amp;type=er&amp;locations=45,-80.899,33.919">Eviction Lab</a>—which tracks eviction filings in select cities—evictions are currently below historic averages in almost every city, including in places where local and state eviction moratoriums have expired. Thus far, <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/02/the-cdcs-eviction-moratorium-threatens-landlords-with-100000-fines-a-year-in-jail-for-noncompliance/">rent payment rates</a> have remained pretty steady during the coronavirus pandemic and are only slightly below where they were last year.</p>
<p>The federal eviction moratorium does nothing to relieve tenants of the responsibility to pay rent, instead only limiting landlords' ability to evict tenants for non-payment. Housing advocates have argued that the moratorium is a half-measure that needs to be coupled with rental assistance to tenants. Not doing so, they argue, will leave renters vulnerable to eviction once months of back rent come do.</p>
<p>A $3.5 trillion relief package passed by the Democrat-controlled House in May included <a href="https://reason.com/2020/05/11/democrats-want-to-give-renters-100-billion-to-cope-with-the-coronavirus/">$100 billion</a> in emergency rent relief.</p>
<p>Toomey thinks that assistance to renters isn't warranted given the relief measures that Congress has already enacted, including the $1,200 stimulus checks and the federal $600 unemployment bonus.</p>
<p>"I think we have to ask ourselves how much expansion of the welfare state, how many different layers, how many different programs are we going to do. When is it enough?" the senator says.</p>
<p>Toomey says that he has expressed his concerns about the federal government's eviction moratorium to senior administration officials. A legislative remedy isn't practical, Toomey argues, given that House would never sign off on a bill repealing an eviction moratorium.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he worries that the effort sets a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>"What future administration, what future president, certainly what future Democratic president is going to want to be accused of being less generous than Donald Trump?" asks Toomey. "Are we to expect that the standard response of the government to an economic downturn is an eviction moratorium? We've never done that before."</p>
<p>The CDC's eviction moratorium goes into effect Friday.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["My vision is nothing short of establishing George Mason University as a national exemplar of anti-racism and inclusive excellence in action."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/02/george-mason-university-president-announces-anti-racism-will-be-important-component-of-reaccreditation/">flagged</a> an email from Gregory Washington, the President of George Mason University. He announced some a high-level program for accreditation titled "Transformative Education through Equity and Justice: Anti- Racist Community Engagement." The email was vague on specifics. In July, Washington sent a follow-up email to the George Mason community with very specific initiatives. (Update: I was forwarded this email today, but it was dated July 23). He explains, "My vision is nothing short of establishing George Mason University as a national exemplar of anti-racism and inclusive excellence in action." Washington explains that anti-racism will be incorporated into Curriculum and Pedagogy, Campus and Community Engagement, University Policies and Practices, and Research Training and Development. I have pasted the entire email below the fold. Here are four high points.</p>
<p>First, the most significant change concerns hiring. The email explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Equity Advisors are senior faculty members, appointed as Faculty Assistant to the Dean in their respective schools. Equity Advisors participate in faculty recruiting by <strong>approving search committee short lists</strong> and strategies and raising awareness of best practices. Additionally, they organize faculty development programs, with both formal and informal mentoring, and address individual issues raised by women and faculty from underrepresented groups<em>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If I am reading this policy correctly, these equity advisors could have a veto at every stage of the hiring process.</p>
<p>Second, the University will now consider "implicit bias" for tenure decisions.</p>
<blockquote><p>We will develop specific recommendations for the renewal, promotion, and tenure processes that address implicit bias, discrimination, and other equity issues (e.g., invisible and uncredited labor) to support faculty of color and women in their professional work.</p></blockquote>
<p>This policy is framed as a way to "support faculty of color and women." But could an applicant's failure to abide by implicit bias justify a <em>denial</em> of tenure? That is, a junior faculty members refused to comply with the <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/02/150-law-school-deans-ask-aba-to-require-every-law-school-to-provide-training-and-education-around-bias-cultural-competence-and-anti-racism/">implict bias re-education program</a>. Would he be penalized by the University?</p>
<p>Third, the University will "require an anti-racism statement on all syllabi." We should be clear. Anti-racism is not some sort of mundane statement favoring diversity. Nor is it a legal disclosure required by federal law (Title IX or ADA). Anti-racism is a political viewpoint. George Mason is a public institution. This requirement is likely a violation of the First Amendment. Consider an analogy that my colleague Jon Adler has raised elsewhere. In the 1950s, a public institution required faculty members to include anti-communism statements on their syllabi. That would be a 9-0 case at the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Fourth, the University will consider names of buildings:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will convene the University Naming Committee to evaluate names of university buildings and memorials to ensure they align with the university's stated mission to serve as an "academic community committed to creating a more just, free, and prosperous world."</p></blockquote>
<p>Umm, the University is named after a slaveholder. Yesterday, I predicted that George Mason University would simply rebrand itself as GMU University&#8211;where the initials do not stand for anything. George Washington University will also rebrand at GW&#8211;where the initials do not stand for anything.</p>
<p>Throughout this entire email, Washington does not define "antiracism." Antiracism is not the opposite of racism. I worry about my my alma matter, Scalia Law School. <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/02/george-mason-university-president-announces-anti-racism-will-be-important-component-of-reaccreditation/">Declaring independence</a> is looking better by the day.</p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> President Washington Announces Task Force on Anti-Racism and Inclusive Excellence</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Hello Fellow Patriots,</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">In the days that followed the murder of George Floyd, I sent you a message that promised action to address racial inequities that persist here at George Mason University.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">As I enter my fourth week as president, I want to share with you the actions we will begin to take, as a community of Patriots.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">George Mason University enters this national conversation with an admirable track record as a pace-setter of action for racial justice, and for truth-telling about our own past.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">We are proud to draw upon the expertise of</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>The Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation Campus Center, one of the first of its kind in the nation.</li>
<li>The Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution, one of the nation's few schools dedicated to social justice and peace, and one of the very best.</li>
<li>The Enslaved People of George Mason research and memorial project, the ground-breaking undertaking by our own faculty and students to tell the full truth of our university's namesake so that we may learn and grow from it.</li>
<li>And of course, we take pride in hosting Virginia's largest and most diverse university student body, with a majority of our students representing communities of color, and our Black student population in particular recognized as among the nation's top academic performers.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400">These are just some of the many examples of excellence and inclusion around racial justice that the Mason community has undertaken. They make us proud.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">But we have work to do if we are to ensure that every student, faculty, and staff member is welcomed and respected as a full equal in this community of learning.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">And the uncomfortable truth is not everyone at Mason feels equal, or is treated equally.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">So, today I am creating the President's Task Force on Anti-Racism and Inclusive Excellence, and giving its members some big assignments.</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>We need to know where systems, practices, and traditions of racial bias exist at George Mason University so that we may eradicate them.</li>
<li>We must build intentional systems and standards of anti-racism that will keep racial injustices from regenerating.</li>
<li>I want George Mason University to emerge from this exercise as a local, regional, and national beacon for the advancement of anti-racism, reconciliation, and healing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400">This task force will have a broad focus, with particular areas of emphasis including short-term and long-term improvements to how we approach:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>Curriculum and Pedagogy</li>
<li>Campus and Community Engagement</li>
<li>University Policies and Practices</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Training and Development</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The task force will comprise many of Mason's luminaries in racial justice, who will be joined by national experts in this topic. Members will be announced over the course of the coming weeks, and they will represent the full diversity of George Mason University, including racial, ethnic, gender, sexual identity, and religious identity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The recommendations that we act upon will be incorporated into the university's planning and budgeting process to ensure they have the priority and resources to take root and flourish. I am not interested in reports that sit on a shelf, only to collect dust.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Many reforms at Mason will require thoughtful consideration over time by the task force and university leadership. Others are obvious, overdue, and simply require executive leadership.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">So, in keeping with my pledge to deliver actions and not just words, I am announcing immediate steps that we are taking to advance systemic and cultural anti-racism at George Mason University.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The many steps that we have identified are available in their entirety on my website, <a href="http://president.gmu.edu/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://president.gmu.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599234853509000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_ITx1hgv2Vo0HEVWOLJLLAnxBSg">president.gmu.edu</a>. The categories of immediate steps we are taking include:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Policing</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">In addition to state-mandated anti-racism training for all police personnel, we will convert the existing Community Police Council into a Police Advisory Board that actively monitors the nature of police activity and reports its findings to me.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>University Policies</strong>­</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">A number of university policies and practices that carry racist vestiges in their practices will be examined and/or curtailed, including:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li><u>Faculty salary equity</u> – We will complete and act upon a faculty salary equity review and work with the schools and colleges toward correcting any issues over a three-year period.</li>
<li><u>Inclusive excellence planning</u> – At the college and school level, we will establish Inclusive Excellence Plans that articulate the vision and definition of anti-racism and inclusiveness for that unit. The task force will develop a metric-driven template for units to use.</li>
<li><u>Implicit bias training</u> – Mason will establish an Inclusive Excellence Certificate Program that certifies that the schools and colleges have completed Implicit Bias Training and have established Inclusive Excellence Plans.</li>
<li><u>Implicit bias recognition in faculty promotion and tenure</u> – We will develop specific recommendations for the renewal, promotion, and tenure processes that address implicit bias, discrimination, and other equity issues (e.g., invisible and uncredited labor) to support faculty of color and women in their professional work.</li>
<li><u>Equity Advisors in every academic department</u> – Equity Advisors are senior faculty members, appointed as Faculty Assistant to the Dean in their respective schools. Equity Advisors participate in faculty recruiting by approving search committee short lists and strategies and raising awareness of best practices. Additionally, they organize faculty development programs, with both formal and informal mentoring, and address individual issues raised by women and faculty from underrepresented groups<em>.</em></li>
<li><u>Recognizing and rewarding adversity barriers in promotion and tenure</u> – We will develop specific mechanisms in the promotion and tenure process that recognize the invisible and uncredited emotional labor that people of color expend to learn, teach, discover, and work on campus.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Racial Trauma and Healing</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>We will increase the support provided students, faculty, and staff through Mason's Counseling and Psychological Services for students, and Human Resources for faculty and staff.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Curriculum/Pedagogy</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>We will finalize development and implementation of required diversity, inclusion, and well-being coursework.</li>
<li>We will require an anti-racism statement on all syllabi.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Buildings and Grounds</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>We will convene the University Naming Committee to evaluate names of university buildings and memorials to ensure they align with the university's stated mission to serve as an "academic community committed to creating a more just, free, and prosperous world."</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Community Engagement</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>We will grow our K-12 and community college partnerships by 50 percent, and become a true partner in the development of our region.</li>
<li>We will establish a lecture series on anti-racism and inclusive excellence to establish a collective consciousness among the campus community.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Resource Commitments:</strong></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>We will identify associated budget to achieve above immediate actions, beginning with an initial $5 million commitment over three years to strengthen initiatives already underway and to fund critical priorities that need immediate attention.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="font-weight: 400">
<li>We will identify an Executive Director for the Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation Campus Center.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Leadership in an anti-racism environment demands that we recognize how our history has shaped our view of the world and how our own actions can reshape it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">My vision is nothing short of establishing George Mason University as a national exemplar of anti-racism and inclusive excellence in action. Given the considerable head start we have on most of our sister institutions in the United States, this is a vision we can realize.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">So, Patriots, let's get to work.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Gregory Washington</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">President</p>

<p>On September 17, from 12 to about 1:30 PM eastern time, the Indiana University Maurer School of Law and the Law and Economics Center at George Mason University are sponsoring <a href="https://law.indiana.edu/news-events/lectures-events/waters-somin.html">an online event</a> on "Crossing Borders, Breaking Borders: New Ideas about Migration, Secession and Political Freedom." The event will feature presentations by Indiana law Prof. Timothy Waters and myself, on our respective new books on secession and "voting with your feet" (the Introduction to my book <em>Free to Move</em> is available for free <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3630646">here</a>). <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/b8b84709-f1af-4659-9ace-57678c35b7f7/regProcessStep1">Registration</a> is free and open to the public. In order to watch, you do NOT have to be affiliated with either university in any way.</p>
<p>The event will also feature commentary by <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/sanford-v-levinson">Prof. Sanford Levinson</a> of the University of Texas, who is one of the world's leading experts on secession, democracy, and its relationship to constitutional theory. Indiana University law school Dean Austen Parrish will introduce the speakers and moderate.</p>
<p>Here is a description from the <a href="https://law.indiana.edu/news-events/lectures-events/waters-somin.html">event website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For all the expansion of freedom in modern times, most countries' borders have remained fixed and rigid. And although capital and goods flow relatively freely, human beings' ability to move between countries or change their citizenship is severely limited. Two new books critically examine these limits, and propose changes. <a class="external" href="https://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/somin_ilya"><strong>Ilya Somin</strong></a>'s book <i><a class="external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0190054581/reasonmagazinea-20/">Free to Move: Foot Voting, Migration, and Political Freedom</a> </i>(Oxford University Press 2020) argues for wide-ranging expansion of people's ability to "vote with their feet" both domestically and across international boundaries. <a href="https://law.indiana.edu/about/people/bio.php?name=waters-timothy-william"><strong>Timothy William Waters</strong></a>'s book <a class="external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300235895/reasonmagazinea-20/"><i>Boxing Pandora: Rethinking Borders, States, and Secession in a Democratic World </i></a>(Yale University Press 2020) argues for a radical rethink of the conventional opposition to secession: Is secession dangerous and destabilizing, or a pathway to stability and greater justice for divided societies? Professor Sanford Levinson will comment on both books.</p></blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://balkin.blogspot.com/2020/05/secession-foot-voting-and-self.html">previously commented</a> on Tim Waters' excellent book at the <a href="https://balkin.blogspot.com/2020/05/balkinization-symposium-on-boxing_27.html">Balkinization symposium</a> devoted to it and F. H. Buckley's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07N94RL11/reasonmagazinea-20/"><em>American Secession: The Looming Threat of a National Breakup</em></a><em>. </em>In <a href="https://reason.com/2020/05/26/tim-waters-and-frank-buckley-respond-to-critics-in-the-balkinization-symposium-on-secession/">this post</a>, I link to Buckley's and Tim Waters' response to the commentators, and offered some brief rejoinders. Sandy Levinson was also a participant in the Balkinization symposium. See his contribution <a href="https://balkin.blogspot.com/2020/05/is-secession-good-idea-in-theory-but.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I look forward to the event!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the Oregon Court of Appeals reaffirmed in yesterday's <em><a href="https://cdm17027.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p17027coll5/id/27206/rec/1">Lowell v. Wright</a> </em>decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plaintiff Lowell, the owner of a piano store, brought this defamation action against defendant Wright, an individual, and defendant Artistic Piano, a competitor piano store for whom Wright works, after Wright posted a negative Google review about plaintiff's business&hellip;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The court concluded that the review was speech on a matter of public concern, but about a private figure, and that some statements in the review were factual assertions and not just opinion; and this would generally mean that,</p>
<p>Under <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), when the plaintiff in a defamation action is a private party (not a public official or public figure), the First Amendment limits the plaintiff's recovery of presumed or punitive damages to situations in which the plaintiff proves that the defendant acted with "actual malice" &hellip; [—]knew that the statements were false or acted with reckless disregard of whether they were false&hellip;.</p>
<p>But not in cases where the speakers are ordinary citizens:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Oregon Supreme Court has expressly held that the First Amendment limitations in <em>Gertz</em> apply only in defamation actions brought by private parties against <em>media</em> defendants. <em>Harley-Davidson v. Markley </em>(Or. 1977); <em>Wheeler v. Green</em> (Or. 1979) ("Although we acknowledge that there is authority to the contrary, we conclude that we were correct when we held in <em>Harley-Davidson</em> &hellip; that the rules first announced in <em>Gertz</em>, applicable to cases in which the plaintiff is neither a public official nor a public figure, apply only to actions against media defendants.").</p>
<p>The Ninth Circuit and a number of other courts have rejected a distinction between media and nonmedia defendants for First Amendment purposes. <em>See </em><em>Obsidian Fin. Grp., LLC v. Cox</em> (9th Cir. 2014) (holding that "the First Amendment defamation rules in <em>Sullivan</em> and its progeny apply equally to the institutional press and individual speakers"). However, the United States Supreme Court has historically made a point of referring to the defendants in its defamation cases as "media defendants," and it has avoided ever addressing whether that caselaw applies equally to nonmedia defendants. In the absence of controlling United States Supreme Court authority, we are bound by the Oregon Supreme Court, not the Ninth Circuit. {Defendants suggest that the Court abolished the media/nonmedia distinction in <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em> (2010), specifically pointing to the Ninth Circuit's citation to <em>Citizens United</em> in <em>Obsidian</em>. We disagree that <em>Citizens United</em> is dispositive on the present issue. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit itself did not treat <em>Citizens United</em> as dispositive, only as indirectly supportive.}</p></blockquote>
<p>The court is correct that it's not bound by Ninth Circuit precedents, only by Oregon state precedents and the U.S. Supreme Court's precedents. And I can see why it would view <em>Citizens United</em>, which wasn't a libel case, as not strictly binding here, though I actually think that the language of <em>Citizens United </em>(and its endorsement of five Justices' views in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders</em>, which was a libel case) is pretty clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers." <em>See Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.</em> (1985) (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ., dissenting, and White, J., concurring in judgment). With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media, moreover, the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred.</p></blockquote>
<p>In any event, it looks like it's up to the Oregon Supreme Court to correct this (assuming the defendants ask for review, which I hope they would); and I hope that court does what <a href="https://reason.com/2019/06/26/minnesota-supreme-court-holds-that-nonmedia-speakers-are-fully-protected-by-first-amendment/">the Minnesota Supreme Court did last year</a>, when it essentially reversed its previous endorsement of the First Amendment media-nonmedia distinction.</p>
<p>For more on the First Amendment providing equal rights to media and nonmedia speakers, see my article on <a href="http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/press.pdf"><em>Freedom for the Press as an Industry, or for the Press as a Technology?—From the Framing to Today</em>, 160 U. Pa. L. Rev. 459 (2012)</a>, the <a href="https://reason.com/2018/04/21/do-ordinary-speakers-have-lesser-first-a/">amicus brief</a> I filed in the Minnesota case, or <a href="http://volokh.com/2012/01/05/motion-for-new-trial-in-obsidian-finance-group-llc-v-cox/">my briefing in <em>Obsidian Finance</em></a>, which I had litigated as Ms. Cox's lawyer.</p>
