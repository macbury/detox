As the number of people using Signal has grown, so have our efforts to keep pace with what people expect from a messaging app, and where we might find new opportunities for Signal.<p>Software companies typically overflow with data that explains the past and forecasts possible futures. They know exactly who is doing what with their products, how often, and where. While an abundance of data can contribute to their product and user experience decisions, these data collection practices are often rife with overreach and abuse. Signal doesn’t track you, collect your data, or measure which features you use. Anything and everything you do with Signal is your business. Which means that for us to dial in the features and experiences you expect calls for a respectful practice of research.<p> <a href="/blog/signal-research/">Read more...</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="columns is-centered"><div class="column is-8"><div class="blog-post-preview post"> <img class="author" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/peter-signal" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/><div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><h3 class="has-text-centered semibold"> <a href="/blog/ice-forking/">Multi-device calls with ICE forking</a></h3><p class="body2 has-text-centered has-text-grey"> <a href="https://github.com/peter-signal">peter-signal</a> on 20 Oct 2020</div></div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><p><img src="/blog/images/desktop-calling-illustration.jpg" alt="An illustration of desktop calling." /><p>Now that voice and video calls are <a href="/blog/desktop-calling-beta">available for everyone</a> on Signal Desktop and iPad, in addition to our mobile clients, we want to share a closer look at the technology that makes it possible for incoming calls to ring across multiple devices.

Users running the most recent versions of WhatsApp on any platform now get full end-to-end encryption for every message they send and every WhatsApp call they make when communicating with each other. This includes all the benefits of the Signal Protocol – a modern, open source, forward secure, <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/">strong encryption protocol</a> for asynchronous messaging systems, designed to make end-to-end encrypted messaging as seamless as possible.<p> <a href="/blog/whatsapp-complete/">Read more...</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="columns is-centered"><div class="column is-8"><div class="blog-post-preview post"> <img class="author" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/moxie0" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/><div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><h3 class="has-text-centered semibold"> <a href="/blog/reproducible-android/">Reproducible Signal builds for Android</a></h3><p class="body2 has-text-centered has-text-grey"> <a href="https://github.com/moxie0">moxie0</a> on 31 Mar 2016</div></div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><p>As of our latest Android release, Signal builds are reproducible.

Now we’re doing the same thing “inside” our apps by renaming Axolotl to Signal Protocol.<p>Axolotl has been the name of the cryptographic protocol that our apps use for end-to-end encryption, but it’s not the easiest word to pronounce. Sometimes people use ‘Axolotl’ to refer to just the base <a href="/blog/advanced-ratcheting">double ratchet</a> instead of the <a href="/blog/asynchronous-security/">full</a> <a href="/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/">messaging</a> <a href="/blog/private-groups/">protocol</a>, so there has also been some confusion around what people mean when they say ‘Axolotl.’<p>To continue eliminating confusion and simplifying everything within the Signal ecosystem, we’re renaming Axolotl to Signal Protocol. The implementations have been renamed, so there are open source Signal Protocol libraries available for C, Objective C, Java, and JavaScript in our <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/">GitHub repository</a>, as before. These have been making their way into an increasing number of communication apps, and we’re excited for the future of the Signal Protocol as it continues to spread.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="columns is-centered"><div class="column is-8"><div class="blog-post-preview post"> <img class="author" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/moxie0" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/><div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><h3 class="has-text-centered semibold"> <a href="/blog/signal-desktop/">Signal Desktop</a></h3><p class="body2 has-text-centered has-text-grey"> <a href="https://github.com/moxie0">moxie0</a> on 02 Dec 2015</div></div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><p><img src="/blog/images/signal-desktop-fred.jpg" alt="Signal Desktop" /><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk"> <img alt="Get it in the Chrome Web Store" src="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/images/ChromeWebStore_BadgeWBorder_v2_206x58.png" /> </a><p>Today we’re making the Signal Desktop beta available.

Today, many things have changed, and TextSecure now emphasizes the “TextSecure transport,” which uses data rather than SMS.

It took some time and a fair amount of patience from my dive instructor before I even made it underwater. But once I reached the calm depths of the ocean, I went from frantically holding my instructor’s hand to feeling comfortable exploring the reefs on my own.

The world is ugly!” they said. “Let us abandon it!” they concluded. […] In short, it was not the discourse of the prophets that was unhealthy, but indeed, the world in which they spoke, the society in which they lived.</blockquote><p>– <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Archeology-Violence-Semiotext-Foreign-Agents/dp/1584350938"><em>Archeology of Violence</em></a>, Pierre Clastres<hr /><p>At the peak of the Soviet Union’s civic society, more than five-hundred thousand Soviets belonged to a complex, almost ecological system of bureaucracy known as <em>the Nomenklatura</em>. Itself a reference to the Roman ‘list of names’ – a codified taxonomy into which people could be organized and signified – the Soviet government was built and constrained through <em>social proximity</em>.<p>The initial idea was to institute a horizontal decision-making system. A methodology that could define and populate thousands of roles for the collaborative administration of social order: ministers of industry, pedagogy, natural resources, foreign relations, internal affairs, communications, and so on.<p>It was a form of governance intended to gradually flatten a hierarchy that the early industrial revolution had exaggerated. However, over time the mechanics revealed – somewhat conversely – a total institutionalization of ‘nepotism’. Certain senior members of the Nomenklatura had the privilege to appoint new members, and maintain long lists of qualified candidates. New members, now obliged from a favor, formed allegiances to their patrons. Patrons themselves carried social debts to those who appointed <em>them</em>, and it went on like this up the stack into the inner circle. The hierarchy didn’t flatten, it sharpened.<p>Speed ahead to our modern life. My social relations are all but completely virtualized. My list of friends and followers, contacts and matches, profiles and handles … all thrum wildly. Apps are released every week which impose and constrain my lists into new formations, reconstructing my social life over and over. It’s possible to see the reflection of Soviet governance in our own lives today; perhaps there are hundreds of thousands of members (less, probably) of a new bureaucratic class – technocratic knowledge workers, let’s say – who organize and signify civic life in the contemporary age. Building cooperative protocols and APIs and apps and networks. Designing the interfaces and behaviors and experiences of everyone else. Teaching but sometimes refusing to learn, giving generously but sometimes taking without permission, anticipating what we want but often supposing what we want without asking. Designing our dismal fate. Slowly appointing their heirs by proximity.<p>As a publisher and designer, I count myself among this degenerate few and tread carefully whenever I manage to move or speak at all.<p> <a href="/blog/surrendering-to-the-potential-of-constraints/">Read more...</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="columns is-centered"><div class="column is-8"><div class="blog-post-preview post"> <img class="author" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/corbett" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/><div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><h3 class="has-text-centered semibold"> <a href="/blog/signal-to-noise/">Signal to Noise</a></h3><p class="body2 has-text-centered has-text-grey"> <a href="https://github.com/corbett">corbett</a> on 16 Jan 2015</div></div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><p><em>Winter Break Of Code Day 4</em><p>I’m not sure those attending their first break of code know what they are getting into.

The Right further entrenches itself into political discourse, both in the <a href="http://www.alecexposed.org/">United States</a>, and (more extremely) abroad (<a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/book_racism_becoming_more_acceptable_in_finland/6360055">Finland</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/03/greek-politics">Greece</a>, … et al.).

Every season, new horrors fall from the clouds and rise from the seas as industrial civilization demonstrates that terraforming can also work in reverse. The world’s genetic library – the most prime commons, if ever one existed – is rapidly contracting via extinction, privatization, and engineering.

Then, we spend a few grand purchasing a Chinese junk rig, and equip it with a system of pulleys so that we can man the sails from the cockpit, solo if necessary. Next, we fill the cabin with about as much potable water as we can carry and enough dried food to stave off starvation, and set a course across the northern arc of the Pacific – avoiding the treachery of the South Seas – for San Francisco. The choice of vessel was key, the battened sails and flattened hull of a Chinese junk rig make it arguably one of the safest ships to make a transoceanic voyage alone, not to mention the financial incentives: being rare in the Americas, a well-kept junk rig would go for anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000 USD – not to mention grant you free slip fees at just about any marina from Anchorage to Punta Arenas. How could anyone turn down such a preposterous plot which included adventure on the high seas, a high mortality risk, riches and notoriety?<p> <a href="/blog/dirigibles-chinese-junk-rigs-and-surfboards/">Read more...</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="columns is-centered"><div class="column is-8"><div class="blog-post-preview post"> <img class="author" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/moxie0" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/><div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><h3 class="has-text-centered semibold"> <a href="/blog/merch/">Merchandise</a></h3><p class="body2 has-text-centered has-text-grey"> <a href="https://github.com/moxie0">moxie0</a> on 06 Mar 2013</div></div><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><p>It’s a busy time here at the Open Whisper Systems factory, and we need all the floor space we can get.
