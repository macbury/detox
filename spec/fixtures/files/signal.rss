&lt;p&gt;The latest Signal betas are rolling out today. Inside, youâ€™ll find performance enhancements, a slew of bug fixes, improvements to the mute settings, and if youâ€™re in the United Kingdom, youâ€™ll see support for Signal Payments â€“ a new feature that enables you to send and receive privacy focused payments as easily as sending or receiving a message. This is a beta feature in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-&quot;&gt;beta build&lt;/a&gt;, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Help users in Iran reconnect to Signal</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/help-iran-reconnect/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://signal.org/blog/help-iran-reconnect</guid>
      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;Just over a week ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1353839763388649473&quot;&gt;we announced&lt;/a&gt; that Iranian censors had started blocking all Signal traffic in the country. As an interim solution to help people in Iran get connected again, weâ€™ve added support in Signal for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-TLS-Proxy&quot;&gt;simple TLS proxy&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to set up, can be used to bypass the network block, and will securely route traffic to the Signal service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new connection method is supported in the latest Signal Android beta release, and will be rolling out to production users in a few days. Our hope is that this will help many people in Iran start sending and receiving messages again while we continue to explore additional censorship circumvention techniques that will work there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No, Cellebrite cannot 'break Signal encryption.'</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-and-clickbait/</link>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the BBC ran a story with the factually untrue headline, â€œCellebrite claimed to have cracked chat appâ€™s encryption.â€ This is false.
Not only can Cellebrite not break Signal encryption, but Cellebrite never even claimed to be able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we werenâ€™t actually given the opportunity to comment in that story, weâ€™re posting this to help to clarify things for anyone who may have
seen the headline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding Encrypted Group Calls to Signal</title>

&lt;p&gt;2020 has seen its fair number of challenges and changes. Weâ€™ve all adapted to new ways of staying in touch, getting work done, celebrating birthdays and weddings, and even exercising. As more and more of our critical and personal moments move online, we want to continue to provide you with new ways to share and connect privately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, weâ€™re launching group calls in Signal with the latest versions of our apps. Group calls are free, private, and end-to-end encrypted â€” &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/&quot;&gt;like everything else&lt;/a&gt; on Signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently released &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/new-groups/&quot;&gt;a new version of Signal groups&lt;/a&gt; with group admins, @mentions, permissions, and more. Today weâ€™re adding one more feature into the mix: group links, which let you quickly create a link that anyone can follow to join your group. Like our other new group features, you can create a new group to try it out now, but these features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Research on your terms</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/signal-research/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Signal has always benefitted from our engaged and supportive community, and wouldnâ€™t be what it is without your input and feedback. As the number of people using Signal has grown, so have our efforts to keep pace with what people expect from a messaging app, and where we might find new opportunities for Signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software companies typically overflow with data that explains the past and forecasts possible futures. They know exactly who is doing what with their products, how often, and where. While an abundance of data can contribute to their product and user experience decisions, these data collection practices are often rife with overreach and abuse. Signal doesnâ€™t track you, collect your data, or measure which features you use. Anything and everything you do with Signal is your business. Which means that for us to dial in the features and experiences you expect calls for a respectful practice of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that voice and video calls are &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/desktop-calling-beta&quot;&gt;available for everyone&lt;/a&gt; on Signal Desktop and iPad, in addition to our mobile clients, we want to share a closer look at the technology that makes it possible for incoming calls to ring across multiple devices. Every call placed on Signal has always been private and end-to-end encrypted, but we previously supported only calls to or from one primary device per person. Now, you can make and receive secure audio and video calls from the devices in your pocket, on your lap, or at your desk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Features Coming to Signal Groups</title>

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether itâ€™s staying in touch with family and friends, planning a party, scheduling an event, getting work done, or &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/blur-tools/&quot;&gt;organizing for change&lt;/a&gt;, group chats are an increasingly important part of Signal. Today weâ€™re releasing a new version of Signal groups that gives you a richer private group experience with group admins, granular permissions, @mentions and more. If youâ€™re excited to try out these features now, you can create a new group to do so. These features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signal groups are built on top of the new &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/signal-private-group-system/&quot;&gt;private group system&lt;/a&gt; technology we previewed last year, which gives you a modern group chat experience while keeping your groups private: the Signal service has no access to your group memberships, group titles, group avatars, or group attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; This feature is now available in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest beta release of Signal Desktop includes preliminary support for one-to-one voice and video calls. Call your friends and family on macOS, Windows, and Linux; see their smiles on a larger screen; hear their laughter through the big speakers on your desk; and help us test the next generation of calling on Signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta users get an early chance to evaluate call quality and performance while we continue to improve the interface and work on upcoming features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of people who join Signal every day is still growing at a record pace. With so many new conversations getting started, weâ€™ve heard from a lot of users that theyâ€™d like more control over how they begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With message requests, when someone who isnâ€™t in your contacts starts a new chat with you or adds you to a group, you can quickly see more info before accepting the request, deleting it, or blocking the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes people dive into Signalâ€™s code looking for domain names, and then they send us screenshots asking if they should be concerned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reply with a short explanation that lays out why thereâ€™s nothing wrong, but we understand the confusion. Nobody would be excited about getting a grade like this on a homework assignment â€“ and youâ€™d have to stay after class and ask the teacher what the hell a â€œTâ€ even means on your report about summer vacation (â€œTâ€oo cool for school?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letâ€™s take a deeper look at whatâ€™s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s been about two weeks since we announced &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/encrypt-your-face/&quot;&gt;an initiative&lt;/a&gt; to distribute versatile face coverings to help support everyone who is self-organizing for change in the streets. Since then, weâ€™ve shipped over $25,000 worth of face coverings to organizers throughout the United States. Over $6,000 worth of merchandise was sent to Washington D.C. last week in time for the Juneteenth events in the heart of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to be inspired by the energy and enthusiasm that is helping to shape change in America, and many people have reached out and asked how they can help. In order to make it as easy as possible, weâ€™re opening up a separate donation space to continue funding these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world was a different place when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/reactions/&quot;&gt;announced message reactions&lt;/a&gt; back in February, but expressing the way you feel has never been more important. Instead of being limited to the default set of reactions that we started with, the latest Signal updates for Android, Desktop, and iOS let you react with even more emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signal iOS now includes a new feature that makes it possible to switch to a brand-new iPhone or iPad while securely transferring Signal information from your existing iOS device. As with every new Signal feature, the process is end-to-end encrypted and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/&quot;&gt;designed to protect your privacy&lt;/a&gt;. Transfers also occur over a local connection (similar to AirDrop), so even large migrations can be completed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In the midst of world-wide protests against racism and police brutality, a lot of people are becoming more immediately aware and concerned about the security of their data and online communication. Weâ€™ve gotten a lot of questions at Signal over the past week, so we wanted to briefly recap how it is that weâ€™ve designed Signal, and how we think about concepts like privacy, security, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/blur-header.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Signal app displaying the new blur interface in the image editor.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, people around the world are marching and protesting against racism and police brutality, outraged by the most recent police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. At Signal, we support the people who have gone into the streets to make their voices heard. We believe that something in America needs to change, and even if we donâ€™t know exactly how, we support and trust in the people who are self-organizing around the country to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the people and groups who are organizing for that change are using Signal to communicate, and weâ€™re working hard to keep up with the increased traffic. Weâ€™ve also been working to figure out additional ways we can support everyone in the street right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One immediate thing seems clear: 2020 is a pretty good year to cover your face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Signal, our goal is to build a reliable, secure, and private communication experience that is broadly accessible and simple to use. From the beginning, weâ€™ve designed Signal so that your information is in your hands rather than ours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>230, or not 230? That is the EARN IT question.</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Over the past several weeks, Signal traffic has gone through the roof. New users are signing up at unprecedented rates, and weâ€™ve expanded our server capacity faster than we ever anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means a lot to us that so many people are relying on Signal during this difficult time. When users check in on their families, share moments of solace, smile with their friends, or discuss sensitive health issues with their doctors, Signalâ€™s end-to-end encryption and privacy-preserving technology helps keep this information secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when more people than ever are benefiting from these protections, the EARN IT bill proposed by the Senate Judiciary Committee threatens to put them at risk. COVID-19 has us sheltering in place, but we cannot quarantine our concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/make-privacy-stick/&quot;&gt;announced support for stickers in Signal&lt;/a&gt; less than two months ago. Since then, over five thousand sticker packs have been uploaded. Today we are officially adding two more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.art/addstickers/#pack_id=e61fa0867031597467ccc036cc65d403&amp;amp;pack_key=13ae7b1a7407318280e9b38c1261ded38e0e7138b9f964a6ccbb73e40f737a9b&quot;&gt;Hands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.art/addstickers/#pack_id=cca32f5b905208b7d0f1e17f23fdc185&amp;amp;pack_key=8bf8e95f7a45bdeafe0c8f5b002ef01ab95b8f1b5baac4019ccd6b6be0b1837a&quot;&gt;Faces&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://swoonstudio.org&quot;&gt;Swoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When youâ€™re standing next to a friend who says something funny, you can just laugh. You donâ€™t need to pause and say â€œI found what you just said humorousâ€ or quote their own words back to them before displaying a real-world emoji on your face. This feeling of immediacy and effortless response is what reactions are all about. Theyâ€™re a quick way to share your take on any message, and you can try them today in the latest Signal beta.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technology Preview for secure value recovery</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/secure-value-recovery/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Signal, we want to make privacy simple. From the beginning, weâ€™ve designed Signal so that your information is in your hands rather than ours. Technologies like &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/&quot;&gt;Signal Protocol&lt;/a&gt; secure your messages so that they are never visible by anyone but you and the intended recipients. Technologies like &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/private-contact-discovery/&quot;&gt;private contact discovery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/signal-private-group-system/&quot;&gt;private groups&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/sealed-sender/&quot;&gt;sealed sender&lt;/a&gt; mean that we donâ€™t have a plaintext record of your contacts, social graph, profile name, location, group memberships, groups titles, group avatars, group attributes, or who is messaging whom. Plaintext databases have never been our style. We donâ€™t want to build a system where you trust us with your data; we want to build a system where you donâ€™t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™ve been working on new techniques based on secure enclaves and key splitting that are designed to enhance and expand general capabilities for private cloud storage. Our aim is to unlock new possibilities and new functionality within Signal which require cross-platform long-term durable state, while verifiably keeping this state inaccessible to everyone but the user who created it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;They get slapped on street signs. We wear them on our clothes to identify ourselves to distant coworkers during awkward holiday parties. Some people create massive galleries on their laptops in overlapping levels stacked so deep that the hinges begin to lose their structural integrity and LCD screens struggle to remain upright. The digital versions are even more popular, and we get asked about them a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stickers are everywhere, and now theyâ€™re in Signal too.&lt;/strong&gt; Theyâ€™re a fun way to add a new layer of expression to your conversations â€“ and just like every other Signal feature, they are also encrypted, private, and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Groups are inherently social, and Signal is a social app. Whether youâ€™re planning a surprise party, discussing last nightâ€™s book club meeting, exchanging photos with your family, or organizing something important, group messaging has always been a key feature of Signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signal provides &lt;em&gt;private groups:&lt;/em&gt; the Signal service has no record of your group memberships, group titles, group avatars, or group attributes. Weâ€™ve been working on new private group technology that will enable group administrators and access control, improve group scalability, and set the stage for a much richer group experience â€“ all while maintaining Signalâ€™s unique group security and privacy properties. Weâ€™re moving into the future while keeping what we loved about the past.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/signal-ios-3.0-on-ipad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Signal running on an iPad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signal 3.0 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8&quot;&gt;now available in the App Store&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPad support has arrived. Set up your favorite tablet as a linked device.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forward messages between threads. Editing support lets you amend, extend, append, explain what you intend, or tie up loose ends before you hit send.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-in support for video trimming can help any clip turn into a highlight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap on someoneâ€™s avatar in a group conversation to quickly message or call them. While the group agonizes over dinner plans, subtly exert your influence by making a case for your favorite restaurant in one-on-one conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jump between threads and survey your message landscape (in landscape) with a horizontal inbox/conversation view on larger devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank all of the alpha and beta users who helped us test and stabilize this release. If you want to get an early preview of new Signal features, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-&quot;&gt;join the beta community here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The latest releases of Signal for Android, Desktop, and iOS are rolling out now with the ability to send optional link previews. This feature is built
on the same foundation that has powered Signalâ€™s animated GIF search for more than two years and that we have since &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/signal-and-giphy-update/&quot;&gt;expanded with additional privacy
enhancements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/link-previews-animation.gif&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; alt=&quot;Animation that displays a link preview being created on iOS.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re launching link previews with initial support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/&quot;&gt;Imgur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. These are four of the most popular sites on the Internet and their heavy
focus on visual content makes them a perfect fit for this feature. We donâ€™t believe that privacy is about austerity, and now Signal users can see
whatâ€™s behind the URL while sharing this content with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Like many others, we have been following the latest developments in Australia related to the â€œAssistance and Accessâ€ bill with a growing sense of
frustration. The widespread adoption of strong cryptography and end-to-end encryption has given people around the world the ability to protect their
personal information and communicate securely. Life is increasingly lived online, and the everyday actions of billions of people depend on this
foundation remaining strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to roll back the clock on security improvements which have massively benefited Australia and the entire global community is a
disappointing development.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In addition to the end-to-end encryption that protects every Signal message, the Signal service is designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/bigbrother/&quot;&gt;minimize the data that is retained
about Signal users&lt;/a&gt;. By design, it does not store a record of your contacts, social graph, conversation list,
location, user avatar, user profile name, group memberships, group titles, or group avatars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/private-contact-discovery/&quot;&gt;exploring techniques&lt;/a&gt; to further reduce the amount of information that is accessible to the service,
and the latest beta release includes changes designed to move Signal incrementally closer to the goal of hiding another piece of metadata:
who is messaging whom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A letter from Amazon</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front</guid>
      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;Last week, we received the following email from Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Menlo,Monaco,Consolas,monospace; margin-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From: [redacted], [redacted] &amp;lt;[redacted]@amazon.com&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Subject: Notification of potential account suspension regarding AWS Service Terms
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moxie,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday AWS became aware of your GitHub and Hacker News/ycombinator posts describing how Signal plans to make its traffic look like traffic from another site, (popularly known as â€œdomain frontingâ€) by using a domain owned by Amazon --  Souq.com.  You do not have permission from Amazon to use Souq.com for any purpose.  Any use of Souq.com or any other domain to masquerade as another entity without express permission of the domain owner is in clear violation of the AWS Service Terms (Amazon CloudFront, Sec. 2.1: â€œYou must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFrontâ€).  It is also a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy by falsifying the origin of traffic and the unauthorized use of a domain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are happy for you to use AWS Services, but you must comply with our Service Terms.  We will immediately suspend your use of CloudFront if you use third party domains without their permission to masquerade as that third party.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[redacted]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
General Manager, Amazon CloudFront
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Long before we knew that it would be called Signal, we knew what we wanted it to be. Instead of teaching the rest of the world cryptography,
we wanted to see if we could develop cryptography that worked for the rest of the world. At the time, the industry consensus was largely that
encryption and cryptography would remain unusable, but we started Signal with the idea that private communication could be simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, weâ€™ve made some progress. Weâ€™ve built a service used by millions, and software used by billions. The stories that make it back to
us and keep us going are the stories of people discovering each other in moments where they found they could speak freely over Signal, of people
falling in love over Signal, of people organizing ambitious plans over Signal. When we ask friends who at their workplace is on Signal and they
respond â€œevery C-level executive, and the kitchen staff.â€ When we receive a subpoena for user data and have nothing to send back but a blank
sheet of paper. When we catch that glimpse of â€œSignal blueâ€ on a metro commuterâ€™s phone and smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Signal, Microsoft is introducing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.skype.com/privateconversations&quot;&gt;Private Conversations&lt;/a&gt; feature in Skype, powered by Signal Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/giphy-ios-header.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Signal for iOS displaying GIF search results&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todayâ€™s Signal beta for iOS includes support for animated GIF search. Signal iOS has long supported sending and receiving GIFs, but todayâ€™s
beta adds support for browsing and searching popular GIFs from within Signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/giphy-experiment&quot;&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; experimental support for animated GIF search in Signal Android, which weâ€™re now bringing
to iOS, along with some privacy updates to the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;Todayâ€™s beta release of Signal for Android and iOS includes support for read receipts. This is an optional new feature that gives you the ability to see and share when messages have been read. Something tells us that you might find this usefulâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technology preview: Private contact discovery for Signal</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/</link>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Signal, weâ€™ve been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/contact-discovery/&quot;&gt;the difficulty of private contact discovery&lt;/a&gt;
for a long time. Weâ€™ve been working on strategies to improve our current design, and
today weâ€™ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/ContactDiscoveryService/&quot;&gt;published a new private contact discovery service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this service, Signal clients will be able to efficiently and scalably determine
whether the contacts in their address book are Signal users &lt;strong&gt;without revealing the contacts
in their address book to the Signal service&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Signal beta for Android and iOS introduces support for Signal Profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profiles allow you to add a picture and display name that will be shown alongside your existing phone number when communicating with other users. Conversations will feel more personal. Group threads will be less confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is possible without sacrificing the privacy and security that you have come to expect from Signal.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The latest Signal beta includes some changes to the way safety numbers work. Back in November, we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/safety-number-updates&quot;&gt;introduced experimental
support&lt;/a&gt; for â€œadvisoryâ€ safety number changes, with the objective of collecting feedback in
order to eventually make this the default experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™ve taken the feedback weâ€™ve received over the past six months and incorporated it into a set of changes that weâ€™re
releasing into beta today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/signal-video-calls-beta&quot;&gt;released encrypted video calling as an opt-in beta&lt;/a&gt;. Weâ€™ve spent the past month
collecting feedback and addressing the issues that the Signal community found in order to get it ready for production. Todayâ€™s Signal
release for Android and iOS enables support for end-to-end encrypted video calls by default, which also greatly enhances the
quality of Signal voice calls as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think itâ€™s a big improvement, and hope you will to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todayâ€™s Signal release for Android and iOS includes beta support for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Signal, and should increase voice call quality as well.
We think itâ€™s a big improvement, but weâ€™re rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with different
devices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when itâ€™s enabled for everyone by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us test on Android and iOS, toggle Signal Settings -&amp;gt; Advanced -&amp;gt; Video calling beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only calls between Signal users who have &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; enabled the video calling beta will use the new calling system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;The latest Signal release includes some changes to the way safety numbers work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety numbers allow Signal users to verify the privacy of their communication with a contact, either by comparing
a number or by scanning a single QR code.  We recently introduced this new design as an update to Signalâ€™s previous UX,
which we felt was no longer adequate for what people had come to expect from Signal.  Letâ€™s look at the safety numbers
design in more detail, then go over whatâ€™s new in this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-timer-has-come&quot;&gt;The timer has come&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this update, any conversation can be configured to delete sent and received messages after a specified interval.
The configuration applies to all parties of a conversation, and the clock starts ticking for each recipient once
theyâ€™ve read their copy of the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Signal for iPhone release now includes multi-device support, allowing you to seamlessly move your private
messaging experience from your iPhone to your desktop computer and back.  Once youâ€™ve linked a desktop
client from within the Signal iPhone app, you can switch to the desktop at any time, whether your phone is online
or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Signal Desktop app also supports a new iOS theme, which is enabled by default whenever you link a desktop
client from the Signal iPhone app.  Try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We recently received a great bug report from Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Markus Vervier, who identified
a problem with the way that image, audio, and video attachments are processed by the Signal for Android
code.  We consider the implications of the bug to be low risk to Signal users, but have
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;released an update&lt;/a&gt;
for the Signal Android app that addresses the problems they reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Messenger has started rolling out &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/07/messenger-starts-testing-end-to-end-encryption-with-secret-conversations/&quot;&gt;Secret Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that enables end-to-end
encryption for conversations within Messenger.  Secret Conversations is built on Signal Protocol,
a modern, open source, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/advanced-ratcheting&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt; we developed for asynchronous
messaging systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Signal Protocol is a modern, open source, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/advanced-ratcheting&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt; for asynchronous messaging
systems.  We use Signal Protocol as the foundation for our own private messaging app, Signal, but
also make Signal Protocol libraries available &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/whatsapp-complete&quot;&gt;for other applications to use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Signal Protocol libraries are open source, licensed GPLv3.  We like the GPL for the quality control that it
provides.  If someone publicly says that theyâ€™re using our software, we want to see if theyâ€™ve made
any modifications, and whether theyâ€™re using it correctly.  This helps to increase transparency and
accountability in deployments of our software, which we feel are important for end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple. The foundation of our
technology is Signal Protocol, a modern, open source, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/advanced-ratcheting&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt;
for asynchronous messaging systems. It is built from the ground up to make seamless end-to-end
encrypted messaging possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflections: The ecosystem is moving</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/</link>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, weâ€™ve been developing open source â€œconsumer-facingâ€ software for
the past four years.  We want to share some of the things weâ€™ve learned while doing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software developer, I envy writers, musicians, and filmmakers.  Unlike software, when
they create something, it is really done â€” forever.  A recorded album can be just the same 20 years
later, but software has to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software exists as part of an ecosystem, and &lt;strong&gt;the ecosystem is moving&lt;/strong&gt;.  The platform changes
out from under it, the networks evolve, security threats and countermeasures are in constant shift,
and the collective UX language rarely sits still.  As more money, time, and focus has gone into the
ecosystem, the faster the whole thing has begun to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means that the set of expectations users have for social and communication features
are evolving rapidly. Anyone building software today knows that it is not possible to stand still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, the Signal Desktop beta has been available through an
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/signal-desktop&quot;&gt;invitation program&lt;/a&gt;.  Weâ€™ve gotten a lot of feedback,
made a lot of improvements, and are now ready to open the beta up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk&quot;&gt;public

      <title>WhatsApp's Signal Protocol integration is now complete</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/whatsappcomplete2.png&quot; alt=&quot;WhatsApp Verification Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple.  A year ago, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp/&quot;&gt;announced
a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with WhatsApp and committed to
integrating the Signal Protocol into their product, moving towards full end-to-end encryption for all of their users by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, weâ€™ve been progressively rolling out Signal Protocol support for all WhatsApp
communication across all WhatsApp clients.  This includes chats, group chats, attachments,
voice notes, and voice calls across Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, Nokia S40, Nokia S60, Blackberry, and BB10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, the integration is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatsapp.com/security&quot;&gt;fully complete&lt;/a&gt;. Users running the most
recent versions of WhatsApp on any platform now get full end-to-end encryption for every message they send
and every WhatsApp call they make when communicating with each other.  This includes all the benefits of the
Signal Protocol â€“ a modern, open source, forward secure,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt; for asynchronous messaging
systems, designed to make end-to-end encrypted messaging as seamless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reproducible Signal builds for Android</title>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;As of our latest Android release, Signal builds are reproducible.  Reproducible builds help to verify
that the source code in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;
is the exact source code used to build the compiled Signal APK being distributed through Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Signal on the outside, Signal on the inside</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/signal-inside-and-out/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://signal.org/blog/signal-inside-and-out</guid>
      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;A few months ago &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/just-signal&quot;&gt;we completed&lt;/a&gt; the process of unifying all of our apps across Android, iOS,
and the Desktop under the name â€˜Signal.â€™  This simplified the language around our apps and eliminated a lot of
confusion. Now weâ€™re doing the same thing â€œinsideâ€ our apps by renaming Axolotl to Signal Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axolotl has been the name of the cryptographic protocol that our apps use for end-to-end encryption, but itâ€™s not
the easiest word to pronounce.  Sometimes people use â€˜Axolotlâ€™ to refer to just the base &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/advanced-ratcheting&quot;&gt;double ratchet&lt;/a&gt;
instead of the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/asynchronous-security/&quot;&gt;full&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/&quot;&gt;messaging&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/private-groups/&quot;&gt;protocol&lt;/a&gt;, so there has also been some confusion around what people mean when they say â€˜Axolotl.â€™&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue eliminating confusion and simplifying everything within the Signal ecosystem, weâ€™re renaming
Axolotl to Signal Protocol. The implementations have been renamed, so there are open source Signal
Protocol libraries available for C, Objective C, Java, and JavaScript in our
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, as before.  These have been making their
way into an increasing number of communication apps, and weâ€™re excited for the future of the Signal Protocol
as it continues to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

your mobile device and your desktop computer.&lt;/p&gt;

which unites simple private messaging and simple private calling into a single app on Android.
This is the culmination of our effort to combine TextSecure and RedPhone into one app, which
we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-new-signal/&quot;&gt;began on iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and are now bringing to completion on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;After immersing myself for years and years in the world of finance
(specifically, options market making and algorithmic trading), there
was no escaping this mantra of â€œno risk, no reward.â€  Most of the
time, my (trading) style was fairly risk-averse.  I knew how to find
the signals of opportunities among the daily noise to reap small
rewards.  Fortunately, I also learned how to think about the outliers
and to take the occasional big but calculated risks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Saying goodbye to encrypted SMS/MMS</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/goodbye-encrypted-sms/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s 2015, and the end of the road for encrypted SMS/MMS in TextSecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TextSecure story started back in 2009, at the dawn of the smartphone era. Back then, TextSecure focused on
securing the transport that everyone coming from feature phones was familiar with: SMS.  Today, many things have
changed, and TextSecure now emphasizes the â€œTextSecure transport,â€ which uses data rather than SMS. While we remain
committed to supporting &lt;em&gt;plaintext&lt;/em&gt; SMS/MMS in addition to the encrypted TextSecure transport so that the app can
function as a unified messenger, we are beginning the process of phasing out support for SMS/MMS as an &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt;
transport in favor of the TextSecure data protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today weâ€™re releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669&quot;&gt;Signal 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, with
support for TextSecure private messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to send end-to-end encrypted group, text, picture, and video messages between Signal on iPhone and
TextSecure on Android, all without SMS and MMS fees. Signal 2.0 blends private phone calls and private messaging into a
single frictionless interface, allowing you to focus on whatâ€™s important by quickly organizing your conversations
using an inbox/archive work flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to listen to another amazing podcast from 99% Invisible, a program about â€œdesign, architecture and the 99% invisible activity that shapes our world.â€ It got me thinking about how my world is shaped by the way I engage with computers. The podcast is a story about a computer scientist named Doug Engelbart who was, in essence, a crazy brilliant genius. He thought of ways to change how we interacted with computers and, most famously, was the inventor of the computer mouse. He also invented a specialized companion device to the mouse that worked like the one-hand equivalent of a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late this afternoon I took a break from working to surf. The sun was setting and a cool breeze was picking up as grey clouds billowed behind the mountains along Hanalei Bay. I had spent most of the day wrangling content, markup, and CSS, and the Pacific was calling. There was still plenty of work to be done, but balance is important, and my mind needed to reset. Surfing would be todayâ€™s lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this life nearly every relationship we create and maintain is built upon expectations. You do
this, Iâ€™ll do that, and together weâ€™ll fail to oppose entropy but stand a chance at plotting and
navigating a loose course through it. These expectations extend beyond the individual, past the
family, and onto society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I watched sunlight dance atop billowing waves,
a natural circus spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I meditated on two syllables,
allowing my breath and heartbeat
to synchronize,
and I too became a part of the show.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code, Day Fifteen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1988 film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the last great
masterpieces to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18qD9hmU9xg&quot;&gt;come out of the Hollywood left&lt;/a&gt;.  In the
film, a drifter named John Nada discovers a box of sunglasses that, when worn, allows the wearer to
really &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, when wearing the glasses, simple advertisements for consumer products are revealed as something other
than what they appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/theylive-messages.png&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;Consume. Submit. Obey.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

questioned my choice to spend my winter vacation writing code, I was excited for the opportunity to spend a week
hanging out with an eclectic group of people while doing two of my favorite things: coding and surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day Thirteen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ten-year-old mind was completely blown when I realized that I could eavesdrop on the walkie-talkie conversations of the other kids in my neighborhood. I rode my bike to the library in stunned silence, found a book about codes and puzzles, and raced home to my computer. I reluctantly transformed &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic&quot;&gt;QBasic&lt;/a&gt; into something other than a conduit for modified games of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIBBLES.BAS&quot;&gt;NIBBLES.BAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GORILLA.BAS&quot;&gt;GORILLA.BAS&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher&quot;&gt;Caesar cipher&lt;/a&gt; implementation that worked in both directions. That ended up being the easy part.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day Twelve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-joyce-scenery.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, someone suggested that we go scuba diving and I said â€œyeah sure, that sounds funâ€. Once
we actually got to the dive site I realized I had no clue what I signed up for. I was scared out of my
fucking mind, squirming against the oceanâ€™s currents, and convinced I would have to go back to shore while
everyone else had fun since I was too much of a wuss. It took some time and a fair amount of patience from
my dive instructor before I even made it underwater. But once I reached the calm depths of the ocean, I went
from frantically holding my instructorâ€™s hand to feeling comfortable exploring the reefs on my own. Instead
of feeling disoriented by being underwater, it began to feel natural to swim among tropical fish and sea turtles.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day Eleven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning at standup Iâ€™d watch the knife spin in slow motion, dread filling my chest and
a voice in my head repeating, over and over, â€œnot Slytherin.â€ (The target of the knife is the
author of the next dayâ€™s blog post). I wasnâ€™t sure that I could find new ways to marvel at
the wonderful absurdity of stepping on a plane and trading reality for this â€“ a chance to
work on the world with a group of people that Iâ€™ve only admired from afar. I wasnâ€™t sure
that I had anything to say that hadnâ€™t already been said by my new friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code Day Ten&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/clpwn&quot;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt;, one of the brilliant full-timers on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/signalapp&quot;&gt;Open Whisper Systems&lt;/a&gt;, looked up from his laptop and asked
me with a smile, â€œSo, Yoko, whatâ€™s your life story? How did you come to love humans so much?â€ It
was a whimsical way of asking why I do what I do and why I am here. Having studied Human Computer
Interaction and being a user experience (UX) designer, Iâ€™ve been asked variations of this question
many times before. But it was on this trip I realized my answer needs a little probing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we hiked the Kalalau Trail and swam beneath the cold spray of a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we discussed the finer points of the axolotl protocol used by TextSecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we delighted in â€œshave iceâ€, a local delicacy that is definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a snow cone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we wrote copy, polished features, closed bugs, and merged pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measured by lines of code, today was short. Measured by steps taken, it was tall. Measured by ideas discussed, things learned, and sights seen, it was towering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-water.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, an email full of information to help prep for Winter Break of Code popped up in my inbox. Throughout my personal countdown to the day I got to leave San Francisco for Hawaii, one line from that email continuously resonated throughout my mind: â€œHave your development environment ready to go.â€&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a day of meetings. Discussion and debate flourished.
Conversations ranged over all parts of every project. Words spoken aloud may
have outnumbered lines of code shipped. The entire team was fully engaged and
people nearly had to be dragged out of the house for an afternoon hike to the
top of the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lilia-ridge-hike.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;View from the top of the ridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite our intense collective focus on conceptual progress, when
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/trevp__&quot;&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; agreed to present an overview of elliptic
curve cryptography, the entire team, veterans and â€œliâ€™l Whisperersâ€ alike, fell
silent and gathered â€˜round the whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned about fields and curves and groups, of basepoints and cofactors,
secrets and signatures. Questions abounded and Trevor delivered the answers,
one after another, albeit with enough handwaving that I thought he might lift
off and fly himself back to the mainland. However, there was one question that
even he could not answer: &lt;strong&gt;Why are they called elliptic curves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Weierstrass to Montgomery to Edwards formats, these geometric objects
that form the essential mathematical underpinnings of many modern crypto
systems are not defined by ellipses, nor do they resemble ellipses. Not
even for very stretchy definitions of an ellipse. There is no immediately
obvious connection. So why do we call them that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, to understand the universe, we must first bake an apple pie from
scratch. Or at least pretend to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been working with Open Whisper Systems on TextSecure for about
a year and a half.  I feel like Iâ€™ve earned better treatment than
being forced to blog at knifepoint, but here we are, so Iâ€™ll tell my

      <title>Surrendering to the Potential of Constraints</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/surrendering-to-the-potential-of-constraints/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code, Day 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The prophetic discourse of the Karai can be summed up in an observation and a promise: on the one hand, they constantly affirmed the fundamentally evil character of the world, on the other, they insisted that conquest of a good world was possible. â€œThe world is evil! The world is ugly!â€ they said. â€œLet us abandon it!â€ they concluded. [â€¦] In short, it was not the discourse of the prophets that was unhealthy, but indeed, the world in which they spoke, the society in which they lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â€“ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Archeology-Violence-Semiotext-Foreign-Agents/dp/1584350938&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archeology of Violence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pierre Clastres&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the peak of the Soviet Unionâ€™s civic society, more than five-hundred thousand Soviets belonged to a complex, almost ecological system of bureaucracy known as &lt;em&gt;the Nomenklatura&lt;/em&gt;. Itself a reference to the Roman â€˜list of namesâ€™ â€“ a codified taxonomy into which people could be organized and signified â€“ the Soviet government was built and constrained through &lt;em&gt;social proximity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial idea was to institute a horizontal decision-making system. A methodology that could define and populate thousands of roles for the collaborative administration of social order: ministers of industry, pedagogy, natural resources, foreign relations, internal affairs, communications, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a form of governance intended to gradually flatten a hierarchy that the early industrial revolution had exaggerated. However, over time the mechanics revealed â€“ somewhat conversely â€“Â a total institutionalization of â€˜nepotismâ€™. Certain senior members of the Nomenklatura had the privilege to appoint new members, and maintain long lists of qualified candidates. New members, now obliged from a favor, formed allegiances to their patrons. Patrons themselves carried social debts to those who appointed &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, and it went on like this up the stack into the inner circle. The hierarchy didnâ€™t flatten, it sharpened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed ahead to our modern life. My social relations are all but completely virtualized. My list of friends and followers, contacts and matches, profiles and handles â€¦ all thrum wildly. Apps are released every week which impose and constrain my lists into new formations, reconstructing my social life over and over. Itâ€™s possible to see the reflection of Soviet governance in our own lives today; perhaps there are hundreds of thousands of members (less, probably) of a new bureaucratic class â€“Â technocratic knowledge workers, letâ€™s say â€“ who organize and signify civic life in the contemporary age. Building cooperative protocols and APIs and apps and networks. Designing the interfaces and behaviors and experiences of everyone else. Teaching but sometimes refusing to learn, giving generously but sometimes taking without permission, anticipating what we want but often supposing what we want without asking. Designing our dismal fate. Slowly appointing their heirs by proximity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a publisher and designer, I count myself among this degenerate few and tread carefully whenever I manage to move or speak at all.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m not sure those attending their first break of code know what they are getting into. When I said &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/&quot;&gt;â€œsureâ€ to Moxie my first break, I sure didnâ€™t&lt;/a&gt;. During that week I had already come to the conclusion â€œI have to see this (TextSecure iOS) throughâ€. In the intervening time, Iâ€™ve become an expert on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codexgalactic.com/2014/01/27/axolotl-protocol-for-cryptographically-secure-messaging/&quot;&gt;Axolotl protocol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/a-whisper/&quot;&gt;come to understand ZRTP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fredericjacobs&quot;&gt;picked up the worldâ€™s best collaborator&lt;/a&gt;, helped with &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8&quot;&gt;the final polish of Signal with RedPhone support&lt;/a&gt; and contributed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;a lot of code to the TextSecure prototype&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it does every morning, the day started with Moxie singing the stand-up song, reminding us all
(and waking up the slackers) that at 9am sharp we all get in a circle to discuss what we
accomplished the day before and what our priorities are for the coming day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I might get sappy, hereâ€™s a picture to ease that before I let it all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-hanaleitown.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being promptly woken up by numerous roosters at 7:30 AM, I still canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m here. My application
was pretty last-minute, completed when I was in a state of droopiness and scholarship-application-hyperdrive.
But I got on a plane from the Midwest, went from cloudy, 20 degrees with windchill making it feel like 0 to
sunny, 77 degrees with mild winds making it feel still 77 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code Day 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning feeling like this routine was normal, instead of implausible.
Two days ago, I was in New York City, riding the train with millions of other commuters
in the freezing snow. Today, I went surfing on a beach in beautiful Kauai. In the same
absurd fashion, I shared meals, stories, and workspaces with people, who days earlier,
I had only read about and admired from afar. The promises of the Winter Break of Code
seem impossible: a vacation in paradise, large milestones of work to be met, a welcoming
space with talented companions. But when Moxie came into the bedroom this morning strumming
his ukulele to wake us for the daily morning stand-up, up we were, ready to claim the small
victories in the browser extension project, the Signal iOS client, and the Android applications
from the day prior and to lay out plans to further the state of user-friendly secure
communication tools.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Every year when we do this kind of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/winter-of-code&quot;&gt;call for proposals&lt;/a&gt;, our experience from past events sets our
expectations higher.  Even with really high expectations this time around, we were blown away by the number of high-quality
proposals we received for this winter.  Itâ€™s inspiring to know how many people are thinking seriously about the development
of privacy-enhancing technology, and we hope that one day weâ€™ll have a space large enough to accept all the proposals
that we wish we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lineup for this January is set to be really great:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple.  For the past three years, weâ€™ve
been developing a modern, open source, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/&quot;&gt;strong encryption protocol&lt;/a&gt;
for asynchronous messaging systems, designed to make seamless end-to-end encrypted messaging possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today weâ€™re excited to publicly announce a partnership with WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in the world,
to incorporate the TextSecure protocol into their clients and provide end-to-end encryption for their users by default.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This January, Open Whisper Systems will be hosting a &lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code&lt;/em&gt;.  Weâ€™ve managed to get access to a
large beachfront house in Kauai for three weeks, and weâ€™re inviting people to join us.  If youâ€™re interested in spending
one to three weeks in Hawaii working collaboratively on an Open Source project to make private communication simple, weâ€™ll take
care of your airfare and housing so that you can be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break Of Code&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunity for designers, developers, writers, strategists, and creative thinkers interested in privacy
and security to spend some time contributing to privacy-related projects in a retreat-like setting with other co-conspirators.
Think of it as an extended hackathon, but with your travel expenses paid, and with breaks for surfing, hiking, swimming, and
just generally being in Kauai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that Open Whisper Systems produces is free and Open Source.  Weâ€™ve been working on apps like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;TextSecure&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone&quot;&gt;RedPhone&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anhonesteffort.flock&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;
for years now, because we believe that itâ€™s possible to develop well-designed
apps that are both privacy-preserving &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a joy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we want everyone to have access to advanced secure communication tools that
are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending a normal text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, weâ€™ve been working to bring the privacy software weâ€™ve developed for Android to the iPhone,
and today weâ€™re releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id874139669&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; â€“ free, worldwide, encrypted
voice calls for iPhone, and fully compatible with RedPhone for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we believe users should have both privacy and powerful services.
Today weâ€™re releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anhonesteffort.flock&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt;,
a private cloud sync service for your personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your contacts and calendars belong to you.  So does your privacy.  Flock makes it possible
to have both.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the major features we introduced in the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-new-textsecure/&quot;&gt;TextSecure v2&lt;/a&gt; release was private group chat.
We believe that group chat is an important feature for encrypted communications projects, so we wanted
to try to summarize some of the existing work in this area, as well as how TextSecureâ€™s group chat protocol
functions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New TextSecure: Privacy Beyond SMS</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/the-new-textsecure/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;Todayâ€™s &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;release of TextSecure&lt;/a&gt; is the final
step in the transition from a private SMS app to a private asynchronous IM app that does not depend on SMS/MMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the lessons weâ€™ve learned from the SMS environment over the past four years, weâ€™ve developed an open protocol
for asynchronous chat that enables private communication instantly with friends, private groups for real-time collaboration, 
and the ability to quickly and seamlessly share media privately â€“ all without depending on SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-rhodey-surfn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rhodey surfing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Break of Code 2013 I cut open my foot and hand while surfing; both wounds
easily warranted stitches. Winter Break of Code 2014 I banged the top of my foot
surfing over some coral; the cuts were sealed within minutes. Spring Break of
Code 2013 I struggled with the Android SDK, while Winter Break of Code 2014 I
caught myself taking a few too many short-cuts. On day zero nothing is easy, but
over time you improve, spilling a little less blood every time.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code, Day Six&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of great memories will stay with me after this intense week. The house 
surrounded by palm trees, people with computers in every corner, laying down on a 
sofa, chatting on the balcony, and sitting down on the carpet. The surf and hiking 
breaks on this astonishing Kauaiâ€™s landscape, sharp mountains covered by forests 
falling into beaches of fine sand and fun waves. The nights spiced with Moxieâ€™s 
tasty cocktails and long deep conversations about the meaning of life, the 
internet and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-meskio-mountains.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Northern sea cliffs of Kauai from the Na Pail Coast trail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The value of our confidences</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/wboc-tyler-jump.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jumping off the pier at Hanalei Bay&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-digital-privacy-under-capitalism&quot;&gt;Understanding digital privacy under capitalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If commodities could speak, they would say this: our use-value may interest men [sic], but it does not belong to us as objects. What does belong to us as objects, however, is our value. Our own intercourse as commodities proves it. We relate to each other merely as exchange-values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â€“ Marx, &lt;em&gt;Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thus-spake-the-commodity&quot;&gt;Thus spake the commodity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marx saw modernity more acutely than most of his contemporaries, and provided a description of capitalism that remains, in my opinion, quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we must be brave enough to attempt to  understand his description of the relationship between commodity and value in the context of a world very different from Industrial Revolution-era Europe. That is, one which includes the strange new primordial soup of the internet and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine, as Marx expects of us in the passage above, that an â€œinternetâ€ commodity could speak. What would it say?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code, Day Four&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Open Whisper Systems &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/&quot;&gt;spring break of code&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, I started work on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS&quot;&gt;TextSecure iOS&lt;/a&gt;. People are chomping at the bit to
use our software on iOS. After a hiatus from the project, Iâ€™ve been happy to return to it over the last
few months, joining some other contributors, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fredericjacobs.com/&quot;&gt;Frederic Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;
as co-lead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nabla-c0d3&quot;&gt;Alban Diquet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cvursache.com/&quot;&gt;Claudiu-Vlad Ursache&lt;/a&gt;
submitting pull requests, even over the holidays, with important cryptographic storage and UI-polishing
contributions, and Bitcoin donations coming in from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS&quot;&gt;Contribute code&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/&quot;&gt;coins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code, Day Three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are at the halfway point of Winter Break of Code. We have two homes near the beach shared by 12 people. 10 of us are working on the apps &amp;amp; website and 2 are leading up delicious dinner efforts. Weâ€™ve spent time on the beach, in the ocean, in the mountains, and of course working. Concepts for future startups and tactics about self-publishing books are brewing, and conversations are lined with politics and activism. Work sessions are focused on making cryptography usable in existing Android apps and soon-to-be-released iPhone apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter Break of Code, Day Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all rights, I should not be here. My application was last-minute to say the
least, and little more than a casual note that Iâ€™d be down to reprise my role
from SBoC as web hacker for whispersystems.org. Maybe it was because of my work
in the previous months on tweaking the site layout to be responsive, or because
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/bcrypt&quot;&gt;@bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; (who is infinitely more qualified)
was too dedicated to her work at the EFF to take the time off, or because my
birthday happened to fall on this week, but for one reason or another, the
universe smiled, and here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lilia-wboc-pier.jpg&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;The pier at Hanalei Bay, Island of Kauai&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/winter-break-of-code&quot;&gt;Winter Break of Code&lt;/a&gt;, being closely linked by name to the season of Winter, began with a calm trickle of ex{hausted,cited} people carrying laptops and cell phone collections after a parade of delays and weather issues. Off the plane after a pitch-black descent, the humid fresh smell distinct to this place along with my feet landing on soil was a good hint that we were indeed on an island and this was actually happening. It was very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Difficulty Of Private Contact Discovery</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Building a social network is not easy.  Social networks have value proportional to their size, 
so participants arenâ€™t motivated to join new social networks which arenâ€™t
already large.  Itâ€™s a paradox where if people havenâ€™t already joined, people arenâ€™t motivated to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that while building a social network is hard, most interesting software today is
acutely â€œsocial.â€  Even privacy-enhancing technology, which seems anathema to the aesthetic of 
social networking, is tremendously social.  For people to effectively use private communication software
like TextSecure, they need to be able to know how to contact their friends using TextSecure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BitHub = Bitcoin + GitHub. An experiment in funding privacy OSS.</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/bithub/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, we often get emails from people whoâ€™d like to donate money to the project.  For an OSS project, 
particularly one that aspires to a collective sense of ownership, handling donations is not always entirely straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental contradiction is that while donations are meant for a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;, theyâ€™re traditionally sent to a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;.
Even if a project sets up a bank account, there are still only a few people who have access to the money itself, and 
distributing it appropriately can be hard to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s never been clear to us how we should handle small donations, so oftentimes when people ask about donating, we just tell
them that the best way to help is to use the software, spread the word, and file well-documented bugs when they find them.  Which
is true!  But itâ€™d also be great if we had a nice system for handling donations that matched our objectives for collective ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;After our wonderful experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure&quot;&gt;Spring Break Of Code&lt;/a&gt;, we were excited to try this
again.  Even with high expectations based on our experience in the Spring, the response was still better than what
we could have hoped for.  The hundreds of high-quality proposals we received were really inspiring, and
we hope that one day we can get a space large enough for all of the amazing people who are passionate 
about the development of privacy-enhancing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think the final lineup of those attending in January is going to be great:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TextSecure, Now With 10 Million More Users</title>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, weâ€™re working to both advance the state of the art for secure communication
and also reduce the friction required for ordinary people to make use of it.  We want everyone to have
access to advanced secure communication methods that are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending 
a normal text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these goals in mind, weâ€™ve been working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyanogenmod.org/&quot;&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt; over the past few months.
CyanogenMod is an open source aftermarket Android firmware distribution with &lt;a href=&quot;http://stats.cyanogenmod.com/&quot;&gt;ten million users&lt;/a&gt; 
and ~20k installs a day. Their rapid growth is beginning to rival Microsoft for the third-largest smartphone OS distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, the TextSecure protocol will begin shipping as part of the CyanogenMod OS-level SMS provider, in an effort to provide
completely transparent end-to-end text message encryption between all of their users.&lt;/p&gt;

The TextSecure protocol was originally a derivative of &lt;a href=&quot;https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/Protocol-v3-4.0.0.html&quot;&gt;OTR&lt;/a&gt;, 
with minor changes to accommodate it for transports with constraints like SMS or Push.  Some of the recent 
changes weâ€™ve made include 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://whispersystems.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability&quot;&gt;simplifying and improving OTRâ€™s deniability&lt;/a&gt;, as well as
creating a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/asynchronous-security&quot;&gt;key exchange mechanism for asynchronous transports&lt;/a&gt;.
Our most recent change incorporates what we believe to be substantial improvements to OTRâ€™s forward secrecy â€œratchet.â€&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winter Break Of Code</title>

        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems, weâ€™re focused on creating easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology.  Our projects are free, Open Source,
and tend to be oriented around the mobile environment.  Weâ€™ve been working on apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;TextSecure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone&quot;&gt;RedPhone&lt;/a&gt; 
(which provide secure text messages and secure phone calls) for years now, because we believe that itâ€™s possible to develop 
well-designed secure communication tools that are both privacy-preserving &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a joy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This winter, weâ€™d like to invite you to join us for â€œWinter Break Of Code,â€ a week-long free trip to Kauai for anyone
whoâ€™d like to spend a week working on this type of easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology in a collaborative
environment.  Weâ€™ve rented a large beachfront house on the north coast of Kauai for everyone to stay
in, and weâ€™ll pay for your airfare.  While there, you can split your time between island living and working on an Open Whisper
Systems-related privacy project that you propose.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My cell phone used to be a black and white Nokia until a couple of weeks ago when I decided to enter in the smartphone world. 
Now that there are more mobile devices connected to the internet than computers, I think itâ€™s time for me as well to discover 
the possibilities of this technology. During this few weeks Iâ€™ve been playing with my new toy, checking how to secure it, and seeing 
what free software is around to use cryptography on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Forward Secrecy for Asynchronous Messages</title>
      <link>https://signal.org/blog/asynchronous-security/</link>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, asynchronous messaging systems such as email have relied on protocols like PGP or S/MIME for
cryptographic security.  These protocols work the way most people are familiar with: one who wishes to receive
encrypted email advertises a public key, and those wishing to send encrypted email to that person encrypt their
outgoing message with that public key.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simplifying OTR deniability.</title>

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Open Whisper Systems we help develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&quot;&gt;TextSecure&lt;/a&gt;, an
encrypted chat application for Android.  TextSecure was designed as a general purpose SMS/MMS client which would also 
automatically encrypt conversations when communicating with other TextSecure users.  For those encrypted sessions, TextSecure
uses a compact derivative of the well-known &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/&quot;&gt;OTR protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re currently in the process of transitioning TextSecure to use a deviceâ€™s data channel as a transport for communication 
with other TextSecure users whenever possible.  This enables communication with the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/iphone-rsn&quot;&gt;TextSecure for iOS&lt;/a&gt;,
helps users avoid SMS fees, and obscures conversation metadata from telcos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition to a new transport is also a good opportunity for us to evaluate and introduce additional cryptographic 
protocol changes.  Below is one cryptographic protocol change weâ€™re thinking of making that weâ€™d welcome feedback on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Call Quality Metrics</title>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Six&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because secure systems arenâ€™t valuable if theyâ€™re not used, Whisper Systems has always focused on delivering strong 
cryptography alongside a great user experience.  Thatâ€™s the reason &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whispersystems.org/blog/client-side-audio-quality&quot;&gt;call quality&lt;/a&gt; has always been a priority in RedPhoneâ€™s development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that, for many users, RedPhone has consistently delivered a call quality experience comparable to commercial 
mobile VoIP solutions.  But we also hear from users who report problems like dropped calls, distracting levels of echo 
and latency, or inaudibly low in-call volume.  While we investigate these reports and attempt to resolve them, we donâ€™t 
have a clear view of what situations cause RedPhoneâ€™s call quality to degrade, or how to prioritize our development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Five&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/feet.png&quot; class=&quot;nice&quot; alt=&quot;Bare feet in the sand&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know very well that each and every crisis of modernity is concentrating, concatenating, and seating more deeply into 
everyday life. I know the struggles of the worldâ€™s unseen and unheard are being subsumed â€“ appropriated â€“ under and 
into the framework of a liberal democracy, leaving those at the periphery still under the yoke of capital. The Right further 
entrenches itself into political discourse, both in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alecexposed.org/&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and (more extremely) 
abroad (&lt;a href=&quot;http://yle.fi/uutiset/book_racism_becoming_more_acceptable_in_finland/6360055&quot;&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/03/greek-politics&quot;&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, â€¦ et al.). The Left is no less problematic: 
reiterating the petty values of social democracy, negotiating the terms of our entrapment within capitalism. Every season, 
new horrors fall from the clouds and rise from the seas as industrial civilization demonstrates that terraforming can also 
work in reverse. The worldâ€™s genetic library â€“ the most prime commons, if ever one existed â€“ is rapidly contracting via 
extinction, privatization, and engineering. The colossal failure of ideology in the twentieth century has left the radicals 
of today no other choice but to see themselves as â€œpost-ideologicalâ€. This is a deeply concerning conundrum, as ideology 
survives in post-ideology, different only to the extent that it is less apparent. Yes, it seems like we are living in end 
times â€“ an entire era of Apocalypse â€“ made only more insidious by our optimism in its shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Four&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main sound on top of the ocean is the click clack of laptop keys,
and the jangle of test calls and SMSes. A neighbor stopped by to
comment that we must be the next Facebook, the next Google; working
instead of surfing made sense in his mind only in the land of money at
the end of the tunnel. He loaned us his stand up paddle boards, surely
expecting a return on investment 10 fold down the line when we exited
into the sunset. A journalist visiting Open Whisper Systemsâ€™ Spring
Break of Code commented that she expected more philosophy, politics,
and conversation. After all this group is composed of people who are
not only technologists, but also open source evangelists, activists,
and humanists. &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/streamlining-textsecure-settings/&quot;&gt;Lilia&lt;/a&gt; went over 
some of the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, but practically anyone
could see we were concentrating on the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, and in the frenzied silence
it was clear that a common philosophy was assumed and what bound us
here was the challenges in the technology to power that philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day Three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no stranger to Hawaii. Although Iâ€™ve never lived here myself, Iâ€™ve visited
the islands perhaps a dozen times. My grandmother and my father were born and
raised here. My mother attended college here. I have aunts, uncles, and cousins
whoâ€™ve lived on various islands, moved away, came back, moved away and back
again. I even have Native Hawaiian blood in my veins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this trip is different. This time itâ€™s not about family or heritage. This
time, I have a mission: to make secure text messaging and calling easier, more
accessible, and more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â€œI am torn on how best to introduce myself out of context like this, the idea of rattling off facts from my resume is my 
first instinct, but that seems terribly conventional. With the goal of introducing myself and the entirety of my character, 
my second (highly unconventional) instinct is to link you to my online dating profile with the prayer that such an action 
would be taken in the desired context. Through my indecision I hope to explain who I am and why I would like to travel 
across the country to be involved with the Institute for Disruptive Studies. So here goesâ€¦â€&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code, Day One.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first times I met up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/moxie&quot;&gt;Moxie&lt;/a&gt; while travelling, we met at a dive bar in 
San Franciscoâ€™s Mission District, packed with hipsters. I had nineteen years, a modified state ID card, and just 
hitchhiked into town. We sat at the bar, and both ordered well gin and tonics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a proposal, the sort of get-rich-quick scheme it seems that only 18th century pirates and lazy hacker-squatters are 
capable of contriving: We fly to China. Then, we spend a few grand purchasing a Chinese junk rig, and equip it with a system 
of pulleys so that we can man the sails from the cockpit, solo if necessary. Next, we fill the cabin with about as much potable 
water as we can carry and enough dried food to stave off starvation, and set a course across the northern arc of the 
Pacific â€“ avoiding the treachery of the South Seas â€“ for San Francisco. The choice of vessel was key, the battened sails 
and flattened hull of a Chinese junk rig make it arguably one of the safest ships to make a transoceanic voyage alone, not 
to mention the financial incentives: being rare in the Americas, a well-kept junk rig would go for anywhere from $50,000 
to $250,000 USD â€“ not to mention grant you free slip fees at just about any marina from Anchorage to Punta Arenas. How could 
anyone turn down such a preposterous plot which included adventure on the high seas, a high mortality risk, riches and notoriety?&lt;/p&gt;

was better than we anticipated: over 100 extremely impressive proposals from folks around the world who are 
passionate about pushing the envelope of security and privacy software.  After reading all the proposals, we 
really wish weâ€™d rented a bigger house.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;RedPhone is our mobile app for end-to-end encrypted voice calls.  When we talk about RedPhone, we tend to 
emphasize the cryptography, and how using it can help keep your communications safe.  What we donâ€™t talk about 
as much is the VoIP application underneath all of that, which it turns out was actually the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were developing RedPhone, we discovered that the cryptographic aspects of it were relatively straightforward. 
What we didnâ€™t anticipate was how difficult the mechanics of delivering high-quality, low-latency, and highly available 
voice communication would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This describes the basic strategy we developed for the network side of low-latency and highly available calls.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This Spring will be the first Open Whisper Systems &lt;em&gt;Spring Break Of Code&lt;/em&gt;, a week-long, expenses-paid retreat to
Maui for folks who like software development, security, and the beach.  Weâ€™ve rented a large beachfront house on 
the west coast of Maui for everyone to stay in, and will pay for your airfare.  While there, you can split your 
time between island living and working on an Open Whisper Systems-related project that you propose.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Whisper Systems was a company focused on the development of mobile security software, which was acquired by 
Twitter in late 2011.  Twitter very generously made some of the Whisper Systems software available under an 
Open Source license (GPLv3), which has since been under open development by the community.  The software has 
seen a number of new releases based on that open development, and weâ€™ve been calling the project for this 
continued work â€œOpen Whisper Systems.â€  Welcome to the projectâ€™s new home.&lt;/p&gt;
